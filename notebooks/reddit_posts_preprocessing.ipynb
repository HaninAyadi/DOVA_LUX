       " \"I threw up . Symptoms are gone Okay so I'll preface this by saying that I am not a hectic reddit person . So I found this subreddit a few weeks back when I Googled my symptoms . It was god sent because before that my doctors and specialists were all drawing blanks as to why I'm still presenting with medical issues after testing negative on the 18th June . I tested positive 28th May , and from there it was teriible . I initially had the most excruciating headache and raw feeling in my nostrils and other symptoms that I mistook for pressure changes because of the weather . Then on the 27th May , I woke up and I was unable to walk even 10 steps without being out of breath . Long story short , I had a bad case of the Covid ( we have 2 oxygen portable machines at home because my mother fell ill a few years back and was diagnosed with a lung disease ) . So I refused to to to the hospital , I have no medical insurance so there was no way I'd be able to go to the public government hospitals in our country . My oxygen levels were verrrry low in the first week . 82 was the lowest . I gradually got better . My doctor did prescribe a lot of medication for me , I was on a very strict supplement regimine too and I'd Google all the oxygen related things to make sure I'm doing it properly . Unfortunately I passed the Covid onto my mother and sister . So nothing overly rigorous but I didn't take it super easy either . Just medium levels of everything because I didn't want to jinx my recovery . I start experiencing tight chest , my right side ribs feel sore and my knee is giving me problems . All out of the blue ! ! I didn't pay too much attention to this until towards the end of August when I started getting shortness of breath again and general fatigue . The brain fog wasn't getting better , and I had ZERO concentration ability ( BTW , I have ADHD already but its under control with meds but wow ... I felt like my medication wasn't doing a damn thing . Now towards September everything was going downhill quick so I thought I had contracted it again . I tested but It came back negative . Now here's the thing , the symptoms seem to have come on super quickly . Almost like getting sick again . It was jarring . At this time I felt as though I has water trickling down my legs . My shoulders and upper back have a sensation like thousands of needles pricking me at once . I have this weird paraesthesia on both my hips and immediate numbness of my arms if I lie down so I had to avoid resting on my sides . It was unbearable . This was naturally accompanied by high levels of anxiety because at this point I'm convinced I have a serious looming disability or disease . September 16-24 I went to various specialists and doctors for tests and checks . Mind you , my energy levels are always on zero and I'm presenting with low blood sugar levels so it's all just exhausting to have to be driven around and taken care of . Absolutely nothing wrong so that freaked me out because I thought the xrays of my chest would at least show my doctor that I'm not lying . It was frustrating because I could feel something is way off . Monday morning I started to feel very very very tired . My stomach was upset , I had a temper , a headache , super awful cramps in my lower back . At this point I'm scared so I go to the pharmacy to get medication for the temperature and my doctor to be put on an IV for sodium something ( idk the full name ) because my blood pressure was super low . I came home around 3pm and slept . At around 9pm , the stomach aches were crazy . I went to the toilet and had diarrhea for days . I thought I'd pass out . Whilst still On the toilet , I started throwing up very violently . The stench was powerful , so acid , so strong ewww . I can not even start to explain how painful the throwing up was , my throat is still raw and painful 3 days later . I slept thereafter at around 1am after the awful ordeal . Funny thing happens on Tuesday , I am not tired . I have only direct pain from the throwing up . I'm just super hungry but otherwise I feel incredible . It's been like that every single day . I HAVE no nerve pain or pins and needles . So I don't know the link between throwing up and inflammation but I suspect I had too much ' acid ' in my body . I'm not sure how to explain what happened but I swear I have no more symptoms . My tight chest is GONE ! NOTHING GUYS .

They said I'm fine . Then those pains went away for a while . Then the week after Christmas I started getting bad chest pains and went back to hospital . Again , I'm fine they said . It must be a musculoskeletal issue they said . But they didn't know what the specific issue was . I kept suffering until one day I was really fed up and went on a mission online to find a solution . Found out it was likely costochondritis and I started doing this weird exercise some guy in a youtube comments section recommended and it worked like a charm . Sorted . Then about 8 weeks ago I got sick for like 5 days . For the first couple days it was like all the muscles in my body had turned into lettuce and my brain was soup . I didn't want to move , couldn't think straight , it wasn't fun . But I recovered like a champ and everything was good , until just over 2-3 weeks ago when I started feeling really lightheated and mentally fatigued . I figured it'd pass after a day or so but it didn't , and it prevented me from working because I didn't feel safe going to work ( I'm a private hire taxi driver ) . A few days passed and it didn't go away so I went to the walk-in centre because I had no clue what was wrong with me and I was getting increasingly worried . Bye .

I think they just think I'm creating an excuse to stay off work . Anyway after like 10 days the symptoms went away and I felt better for like a week or so . I thought I was all good again .

All the inflammation but none of the congestion . Headache was gone by that evening . Day 4 , tired but inflammation was way down . Managed to get a walk in and do a bit of yard work . Day 5 , actually ended my night feeling pretty normal . Didn't have the best stamina the last couple of days despite feeling better . Having major irritation and overstimulation issues ( that might be because this was my third weekend in isolation because of the way the virus went thru our house ) .

I dont think it allows me to participate in life a professional capacity , so I continue to insist in staying home sick .

I am a 25 year old male who for the past month I have been battling with fatigued and just not feeling myself . I had covid in December last year and I have had extensive blood work done and nothing has shown red flags . One blood test showed my LDH slight elevated at 258 . However I done another one shortly after and it went back into normal range of 242 . My white blood cells were also at 8 at that point which is still within the normal range but the highest they have ever been during any blood test I have completed . Lately this is what I have been experiencing - I have sore lymph nodes on both my right and left arm pit . Two doctors checked them out and said they are fine . They aren't swollen just sore when touched I also have a persistent cough which I cannot shake since I had covid back in December . I get sharp pain on the right side of the chest now and again which also happened to me when I had covid . I have also been experiencing brief spells being lightheaded . I'm seeing a neurologist next week . I have also visited cardiologist which cleared me from anything sinister regarding my heart . I haven't been experiencing any fevers which is good but sometimes I feel hot . Im also 5-6 kg underweight and no matter what I struggle to gain weight . I had my thyroid checked and that's came back all clear . Also I have been getting undigested food in my stool recently which I had to do a stool test which ruled out parasites or blood\",\n",

The months after I had many tiny relapses , usually triggered by stress , allergens , or medications . In December 2020 I had a major relapse that sent me into full on longhaul . Symptoms included : brain fog , heart pounding 24/7 , exercise intolerance , nausea , gi irregularity , fatigue , anxiety flair ups , trouble focusing , sleep issues , muscle twitching , headaches . Went to an excessive number of doctors that told me I had anxiety since every test possible came back normal . Tried most of the supplement aisle at Whole Foods with little improvement over the last 14 months . Got the first dose of the vaccine and almost ended up in the ER from low BP / HR . Before taking DLPA I was borderline a husk of a person and after a few days of DLPA I was a person with some mild POTS . I could live a pretty normal life except I couldn't exercise ( before longhauling I was finishing up running Division 1 track in college , and used to workout / run at least once a day ) . I also still had the heart pounding ( not racing , just feeling the beats ) , although it was milder . Now I have started taking * * magnesium threonate * * . I believe magnesium deficiency and the dopamine depletion caused by its affects to be the root of my longhaul symptoms . I have only been on the mag threonate for a few days ( chose this kind due to best absorption ) , but feel almost completely better now . While I did have some relief from anti-histamines , DLPA relieved all those symptoms and more for me .

I have a constant tightness and pressure as if something wants to escape from my upper chest . This is often joined with a nagging and burning pain that can also go up my throat and sometimes even radiates to my teeth . At times it also feels cold in that area as if I ran 10 miles outside and then took 5 mints . Weird thing is that I don't experience any SOB / POTS / fatigue or issues during or after exercising , sometimes that can even make me feel better for a little while ( thank god I can still exercise , feel like I'm a lucky one among you ) . Sometimes instead of having these issues in my upper chest area , I have this strange pressure feeling in my middle / upper back like something is stuck or squeezing me , but this is not happening that often Right now I'm in the middle of taking omeprazole daily ( 1 week now ) in case it is something like GERD , but I don't notice any significant changes so far . My doctor isn't sure either so I'm having a chest x-ray soon and some blood tests to rule things out . Do you guys have any ideas how to relieve these symptoms and whether it might be GERD but omeprazole just ain't it for me ?\",\n",

Fast forward to the second time it was more like bronchitis , low grade fever , productive cough , just felt sick for about 3-4 days and got better really quickly . I went back to the gym on day 10 but it was a very gradual return I did like 10 mins on a seated bike and some abs just to get a sweat and HR up . I then lifted probably 5-6 x for the next 2 weeks ( last time I lifted was 2/9 ) , something just didn't feel right , I just felt gassed and I chalked it up to being deconditoned but I didn't push myself bc I was scared to . I'm going to try and make this easy to read and not a rant .. POTS symptoms , dysautonomia . Below I will list my symptoms - SOB at random times ; for no reason . Just feel like someone sitting on my chest . ( dysautonomia temp regulation ? ) - my heart rate ahhhhh my favorite :unamused_face: my HR standing up is WEIRD . Laying down it is 50-65 always , but I can feel it beat it like pounds I always think it's high but it's not . Standing up is always a fun game to play , it can sit at 115 or it can just fluctuate 90,100 , 115 you never know . If I wake up from sleep or nap and get up it is BAD it's like a get a rush of anxiety and the mf can get to 150 and it is wild feeling , scares the hell out of me , but I just lay down . - head pressure left temple and back of head . Gets worse the longer I stand - sometimes I'm sensitive to noises that never bothered me before , I have to listen to earphones at like 1/3 of full volume and I used to hate my AirPod pros bc I swore they weren't loud enough on full blast . - My blood pressure is all over , granted I've never taken it or Covid when I was standing , but it ranges from normal to high , highest I've registered was 154/90 , 147/98 , 145/93 . Anxiety inducing maybe , doubt it . I'm leaning more towards Hyperadrenergic pots . - Sleeping is awful , I dread it . I've always had trouble falling asleep , but now it's like my body doesn't know how to fall into sleep mode , when I do I wake up gasping for air and feel like my heart is racing . The other night I swear I couldn't breathe for 3-4 seconds , scared me pretty bae . Adrenaline dumps maybe ? Sleep apnea ? Doug it , my Apple Watch shows normal HR and o2 throughout my sleep . - for 2 days I had burning skin like sunburn but that went away . - crawling skin , like cold chills run through body sometimes . Sometimes I itch a bit . - sometimes ears feel full , rare but happens - insane anxiety & depression . This is to be expected , I'm so afraid I'm going to have a chronic debilitation like POTS , and I wake up not knowing what the new day will bring symptoms wise . I've cried almost every single night . I already had HORRIBLE health anxiety and OCD , I usually thought something was always wrong with me , but it never stopped my daily life . This is real , I haven't left bed much in the last week and a half , haven't ate much I've lost 9 pounds in 10 days . What am I doing for these symptoms ? - I do workouts laying down , like stuff people would do who are going through PT , leg lifts , crunches , just insanely easy stuff so that I'm not just laying letting my body waste away ( just started these 2 nights ago , haven't seen anything negative come from it ) - melatonin 10mg ( has never had an effect on me even before this ) - Claritin 10mg 2x day ( have always done this ) - hydrating ( pedialyte , sports drinks , gatorlyte , body armour ) I think this has helped most honestly with the standing HR - stocking for legs , I think I had some blood pooling - vitamin B12 Doctors visits : Since contracting Covid I've been to the ER 3x . 1st time 1/25 . Coughing small amount of blood , everything clear ( blood work all normal ) , CT with contrast clear , X ray clear . 2nd 2/7 / time I went bc I couldn't get my HR down , first ekg it was 159 just sitting bc I was so nervous , got it to 99 while that that was lowest . Chest X ray clear , blood work normal besides glucose being 130 . but I hadn't ate . 3rd time 2/11 went bc it felt like I was being smothered and ears were full this is when I noticed the HR being high when I stand .. so I got released and told to “ relax and get my anxiety under control ” I was calm it's not like I was in panic attack mode . Fast forward to about a day after and everything started to get worse so I started researching with what time I had away from schoolwork ( what I'm doing rn isn't in person until May thankfully bc I don't leave home rn I can't ) after research and even talking to one of my professors we talked about POTS and dysautonomia , I REALLY started to dig deep into it and realized it's tied to long Covid and I've read tons of articles on it and everything in here as well . I fit it perfectly , it may be it maybe not , but rn I'd fail a TTT for sure , idk what my HR was standing before but not this high I know that . Feel like I'm stuck like this forever and it's only been 2 weeks , I'm an aspiring MD obviously and I won't be able to be a MD like this , it's impossible . Who am I seeing ? I knew a cardiologist personally and asked him if he knew any locally that were POTS specialist or knew a lot about it , and he did and I am going to see him Tuesday , my assumption is he will tell me this has to go on for 3-6 months before he will give me extensive testing . I think he'll throw me on a beta blocker and keep in touch , that's all . But I want to tell him all my sunrooms , been logging my BP's and have done a poor man's tilt test at home a few times ; along with videos of pulse ox to show me standing and pics of the BP machine . I get it's too early to assume anything , but I'm following the patters that most of the people on here have . I'm going to continue researching bc I love doing that , it makes my anxiety better and worse but I have nothing else to do . This is getting the best of me bc I can't live my life at all ; I sit in my room most the time in my bed . I'm hoping this gets better in the next coming months atleast by may I hope I'm functional to complete my last rotation for graduation ! If not idk what's going to happen and it scares me , everything scares me rn ; POTS scares me , uncertain future . I've considered starting Lexapro but idk this might be a bad time to do that .

I'm only 3.5 weeks out from when my symptoms started , so technically not long haul yet , but I definitely seem to be heading that way as I don't think this is going to clear up in the next few days . Initially I took 2 weeks off of work and went back last week . I have a desk job and work from home , and it was a slow week , but even so it was a struggle . I thought I was getting better and could just push through it , but yesterday I felt really terrible , and I'm starting to wonder if working made things worse . I had surgery in October and was off work for 11 weeks , which was longer than initially planned . I literally only came back for 2 weeks before I was out again with covid . So far my work has been pretty reasonable about everything and no one has questioned me for taking so much time off , but I'm worried if I keep pushing it they'll change their tune . Plus I know it is hard for my coworkers who are covering for me , even if they are understanding . Sometimes I feel pretty okay , just a little tired , and I think I've recovered enough and it'll be fine . But then I'll do something like wash my hands a little too vigorously and my arms start aching and I wonder if maybe I'm in denial about how bad I really feel . I have a number of chronic conditions so I'm used to just pushing through sometimes . My pain tolerance is all screwed up because I dealt with really severe pain for a long time , so I'm worried maybe I'm not taking this as seriously as I should . After writing all this out I'm leaning towards just taking the next week off and seeing how it goes .

After 1 year and 8 days of long hauling , I now consider myself recovered . Although I feel different than before I had Covid , I have now accepted and learned to love my new normal life . This experience has taught me so many life lessons I would have never learned without it . It has shaped me into becoming such a stronger person , and I now love the reflection that stares back at me . It definitely was not an easy journey , or a linear one , but I'm going to sum up everything that happened to me / how I am here today . Starting on January 15 2021 my long haul starts . Extreme head pressure is my first symptom . Feels as if a vice grip was around my head . This was followed with the worst fatigue I have ever felt . I could not even stay awake in my college classes . After checking my blood pressure which read 180/140 , I knew something was not right . Went to urgent care , where I got a clean bill of health . All normal blood work and labs . The head pressure eventually goes away , but is then replaced by extreme brain fog and derealization . I could not focus or create a thought to save my life . I felt as if I had Alzheimer's no joke . It felt as if I was out of my body 24/7 . The fatigue , brain fog , tendinitis , derealization , all 24/7 with no breaks . Along with this , I had just uncontrollable mood changes , with what felt like psychosis at times . After months of this , I was put on lexapro and diagnosed with high blood pressure , which also started medication for . In the following months , things didn't get worse , they stayed the same , with a glacially slow line of progress . I received both the Moderna vaccines , which had no affect on my symptoms or recovery progress at all . I quit all medications in July , as I believed they were not doing anything , and to my surprise they were not doing a damn thing . In November , I had a brain mri done , which came out clean thank god and received my booster , which also had no affect on my progress . I was also put on bupropion in late November , which made me nervous from my lexapro experience . But after this , life became different . I really could not tell you if it was the medication or finally time did it's job . I knew I was pretty much recovered when I realized I havnt thought about long Covid in almost 2 months and didn't even realize that my symptoms were gone . I now am back in college full time , went back to my job , and now live on my own again . Life is normal again , and I'm starting to enjoy it for the first time in almost a year .

Bit longer version : Quick bio : Male , early 30s , average weight bit on the skinny side , long-hauling for 13 months . Was on an upswing into late December so I figured I would try doing some simple leg stretches and truly mild exercises like lunges , squats , nothing too crazy . After 12-15 minutes of this I felt okay , then went about my day , taking it pretty easy . For the next 4-5 days I felt like I ran a marathon ! E x t r e m e soreness in both legs , from my calves to my thighs . Shook it off as perhaps just a result of finally using muscles I haven't used much of since I got sick . I took it super easy over the next 7-10 days , ( early-mid January ) mostly played video games and went for some short walks around my neighborhood 2x / day . During this time I started getting sporadic pains deep in my right thigh & also especially behind my kneecap . I started walking with a slight limp that has worsened each day since . I bought some good compression stockings a week ago and have been wearing them and they help BUT here's wear things get really messed up . A few days ago I had the stocking off for a bit and was sitting on my bed checking my phone . I started getting a sharp pain behind my kneecap , similar to what I had been getting but much more intensely painful . I look down at the area on the side of my knee and bent my leg to get a look at the back of my knee and I can see a reddish / purplish super wrinkled area along the inner side of the back of my right knee . It looks gross and feels wrinkly to the touch . I booked a Teledoc appt with an urgent care physician and she told me it's just a varicose vein and to take vitamin E . This is tremendously concerning to me because I'm relatively young , was in good shape before I became a long-hauler , and my leg is continuing to hurt terribly , whether I'm wearing the compression garments or not , day in , day out .

First of all , I do have diagnosed PCOS ( but I do not have cysts on my ovaries ) . From puberty to age 21 my periods have been completely random , sometimes lasting a month , sometimes going away for 6 months , I never knew when it was coming or going . Eventually something clicked into place and I would get my period every month on time , and it's been that way for almost three years , only being a week later than expected or running a few days over my normal 7 days every once in awhile , it's never been more than a week late though , until covid . I was infected in November , and my periods were still consistent until February when I skipped an entire period . It got back on track again , and then April 5th I got my last dose of the vaccine , had my period on time 2 weeks later , and now it's just Gone . I haven't had one since . That's over 50 days late .

I got covid in October 2020 and like many of you it was a mild case - I didn't take any time off work and I think that was my biggest mistake . I thought I was recovered after 2 weeks , but by january , the brain fog and fatigue had kicked in and I knew that , sitting in front of my computer screen at work , the words didn't make sense and I had to take time off to rest . fast forward to June and I'm still on leave , and I'm not sure when I'll be able to go back to work . I'm a researcher , and my work was very thought-heavy , so it's been difficult to empty my brain as such . I still have horrible parosmia , and my mental health was poor before covid , so not being able to exercise and cook food has really left me without any coping mechanisms . on a more positive note , I've noticed that there now seems to be a longer gap between relapses , and I'm able to do more in between them ( have gone from relapses lasting 4 weeks to a few days in most cases ) , so I'm hoping this is a sign that things are actually getting better , and that this is maybe a sign of recovery :crossed_fingers: sending you all strength and solidarity , this is a tough road to be on !\",\n",

       " '. 38M - March 2020 infection - I have a dad bod , but no medical conditions outside of that . Both my wife and I are longhaulers . She still has a little bit to go , but she\\'s getting there too . My first symptoms came one night when I was putting my kids to bed one Wednesday night . I noticed this difficulty breathing , nothing to crazy but enough to notice something was wrong . Fast forward to Friday and I am developing the beginnings of a cold - I\\'m a little run down and I\\'m starting to get sweaty as if I have a fever . I leave work and stock up on supplies ( it is March of 2020 after all ) , since my school announced that they are cancelling classes all next week . I\\'m getting these shooting pains running up and down the front and back of my chest as well . By dinnertime , we can barely move . The first week was the roughest , as any form of media you looked at was all COVID , all the time . It definitely wasn\\'t helping my symptoms .. THE SYMPTOMS : BRAIN FOG - In the week leading up to when I knew for sure I was sick , I noticed that I was having trouble with names and identifying objects . I was losing my train of thought a lot too , but I chalked this up to being super busy . The brain fog lasted a good 6 months or so , but I have been my old self mentally for about a year . SHORTNESS OF BREATH - This started right away and lasted about 9 months . I\\'ve had scans and my lungs look good , but I was still having breathing issues until November / December of last year . It felt like my lungs were stuffed with cotton , but my wife and I also had something we affectionately referred to as \" the bra strap \" . When we would inhale , it felt as if we had a tight band wrapped around our ribcage keeping us from breathing fully . I would find myself constantly checking my pulse oximeter to see how I was doing . At my lowest ( a week or so in ) , my oxygen was 90-92 , then it settled around 94-96 for a 4-6 months . For the first week or two , I couldn\\'t get off of the couch more than a couple of times a day at best . Everything hurt , and it would only get worse if I moved . As the major fatigue dissipated , I discovered the joys of PEM . I have two small kids who are JUST NOW getting to be of the age where they want to play sports all the time . I first noticed the PEM as I tried to get back off the couch and into a daily routine . It took me 7 tries and nearly 2 months to successfully walk around my block once ( a quarter mile , or one trip around a HS track ) without needing to rest on the couch for the next day or two afterwards . I would slowly work my way up to larger physical challenges ( have a catch , walk 6000 steps in a day , then 10000 , etc ) , failing for a while before slowly getting to a level where my body could handle it . I\\'m still not fully back in the sense that I have to think about whether I could physically do something where as before I would just do it , but I feel like my normal self now . I\\'m not working out yet ( I\\'m waiting for after the inevitable holiday spike nationally , followed by the wave of post new years resolution folks . I also want my doctor to give me the green light ) , but I plan to as soon as I can . HEART ISSUES - About a month into my illness , I got to a place where I thought I was nearly cured , then one day I woke up with a week-long headache . Once it had passed , I discovered a new symptom . My heart rate was now regularly between 90 and 110 . It would shoot up if I did any physical activity too , and would leave me feeling it in the form of a headache or just the eerie sense of your blood wooshing through your vessels . I also developed palpitations 3 or 4 months in . I would be sitting there on the couch and it would feel like my heart broke out of it\\'s rhythm . It was like I was getting a quick electrical shock , then I was back to my normal ( ish ) self . INSOMNIA / SLEEPING ISSUES - I used to be a \" head hits pillow and out immediately \" kind of sleeper , but it\\'s amazing how hard it is to get to sleep when you also have to consciously think about breathing . I had countless nights where I couldn\\'t get to sleep at all , where I would have panic attacks in the middle of the night and need my wife to hold me while I shook uncontrollably . I even had a laryngospasm once , which might have been the scariest minute of my life . I lost 20 pounds the first 3 weeks I was sick because of a lack of appetite , gastrointestinal issues , and profuse sweating - especially through my feet . I had body aches in my calves ( it felt like cramping ) , my left knee , my hips , my lower back / pelvis area . Any old injury I previously had seemed to have a few days where it hurt again . I chalk this up to inflammation , as my wife\\'s whole left side went numb a few weeks into this and she still has issues from it . I had constant bouts of shaking / convulsions the first month or two . I had a few mild cases of ED ( it worked , but was a little spongy ) , as well as the opposite too , where I would be stuck permanently at half mast for days . I never lost sense of taste and smell , but it was different . I also got a numbness on the roof of my mouth and the front of my face ( where a hitler moustache would cover ) . While I just thought I was depressed from my situation in the moment , reading some people\\'s depression / derealization posts definitely hit close to home . I had bad dizziness for the first month or so , as well as horrible motor skills - I cut myself shaving so bad a few times because I couldn\\'t hold the razor properly . There were also blurry vision and floaters to contend wit hat times . I had horrible indigestion for a while as well . THE RECOVERY : The main thing with my recovery was time . Based on when I got sick , I was afraid to even take ibuprofen because there were reports of adverse effects due to it . I also couldn\\'t see a doctor for the longest time and I\\'ve never been the type to tinker with random OTC medications either . My wife , who has had pneumonia a few times , told me that her pneumonia passed after a few weeks , but it took her 6 months to feel right . That was my guiding message . I just needed to take it easy and let my body heal itself . I mentioned earlier that I was overworking myself . I was routinely getting 4-6 hours of sleep and I worked out 4 days a week so I could continue to eat the worst foods money could buy . I\\'ve actually had this experience with every vaccine I have had since I have been sick ( both flu vaccines and 2 doses of Moderna ) . Part of me wonders whether it helps reset my malfunctioning immune system by giving it something to do , but I\\'m not a doctor , just a guy who caught a disease one time . I got a quick inital burst of energy from it , but it eventually faded and I stopped taking them unless I need a little bit of a pick-me-up . I also eat an energy bar at work every day that includes tumeric ( which I know has a big cheering section on this sub ) ',\n",

Weight dropped down to 67kg ( from usual 73kg ) , and my diet was very restricted due to GI issues . Once I ramped up omeprazole , I improved my diet / nutrition , and then I started to see real strides in progress . First 5 months were hell , but then I could see improvement was happening so light clicked on at the end of tunnel . In month 2 , I was averaging c . At this point sleep was much improved , and other symptoms mostly episodic . GI mostly resolved and was tapering fast off of omeprazole . Fatigue , restless legs , headaches still came and went . Tinnitus was always on , but sometimes louder , sometimes softer . Headaches in particular seemed to come every 2 weeks or so , almost like clockwork . Month 9 took second jab of AZ , and once again steps / day accelerated , to 6000 / day by Month 10 . Month 10 was also last GI symptom . Stopped all omeprazole and was able to return to mostly normal diet ( caffeine and alcohol excluded however ) . Month 11 hit 7000 steps / day , which is basically normal output levels , but still unable to exercise without PEM . Also in month 11 , had first real test of walking 11,000 steps without PEM ; this was a turning point and from here I began trying to run / lift to accelerate out of the deconditioning trap . In month 12 , when HR > 140 , it would trigger insomnia , restless legs at night . Now at 12 months and small change I can run 4 x 400m at 8 min mile pace , with 1:00 between each , and feel only very light headache in eve as PEM . Also can enjoy very light beer / wine and some caffeine . Cycling easier than running in terms of PEM . Also intermittent fasting ( 15 or 16 hours ) made me feel stronger the next couple days , so I did this a couple times per week . Cold water – showers / swimming – seems to jolt system in a good way as well \",\n",

I had it really bad with longhaul symptoms . I tried every supplement under sun . Some gave a bit of relief but none helped . Low grade fever , brain fog , digestion issues , anxiety , extreme fatigue , chest pain etc . I was desperate and sick of this a week ago due to feeling like this and couldn't take it anymore . Thought , fuck it , might as well try going back to beef , salt and water and see if it helps cause it's anti-inflammatory . I was 95 % better within 48 hours . I am now on day 6 and I pretty much feel like I did pre-covid and that is all I wanted . This isn't medical advice .

For a year , I have done almost every possible medical test that I could have found of . I did blood tests on monthly basis , lung scans , heart scans , allergy tests , I have done numerous pcr and antigen tests to see if I caught it again cause that is what it felt like a lot of times .

       " \". I have been having weird unexplained symptoms since I ‘ recovered ' from Covid 4 months back . I've been to 2 doctors and spoken to a total of 4 doctors all of whom have given me answers ranging from ‘ it's anxiety ' to ‘ you're too young to have any health issues so relax ' like ? ? ? I did not choose this ? ? ? ( I'm 20f ) and lastly that ‘ COVID is a very draining illness so it'll take time for your body to get back to normal ' , but still no solid answers or course of treatment and the worse part was that they weren't even ready to run tests to atleast check if there's something wrong . My family is also not really supportive because they believe the doctors more than me I guess and they think I'm exaggerating and making up symptoms because I have anxiety . The craziest part for me was when I developed parosmia . It's a taste disorder which makes everything taste like garbage . When this happened I was very close to a mental breakdown because everyone around me seemed to have recovered and living normal lives but here I am developing something or the other every week .

What started out for me as the worst personal year I've ever had , ended up being the best year of my life , even with all my health issues . So let's start at the beginning . Myself and my pregnant Wife came down with symptoms just shy of 2 weeks later . I had an odd feeling that this was COVID , but couldn't really figure out why . After two weeks of moderate symptoms , I recovered . Or so I thought . I went back to my normal life and training . Running , lifting , crossfit , and mma . Two weeks after that , all my symptoms came back way way worse and I ended up in the ER twice . The next 6 months were a living hell . I went from being a competitive athlete , to someone who couldn't even walk up the stairs in one shot . My heart rate and blood pressure were all over the map . Through all this , both my wife and I lost our jobs , income , and most of our savings . My symptoms got better to a point , and then have just stagnated in the bloom and fade cycle since . Most days I'm maybe 50 % of what I used to be . In March of this year I took a new job , and all is well again in our house \",\n",

CT showed some diverticulosis but no inflammation and nothing anywhere else throughout my body . She prescribed me with 250mg of fluconazole for 7 days . I weighed myself for the first time since all of this happen and I was 165 when I was 180 a week and a half prior . 3/10- 3/11 I started to feel a little better since I was hydrated and I was able to drink water again since my anxiety had gone down . 3/12 I got my second covid vaccine 3/13- 3/17 Although not visible , felt like swollen lymph nodes all down my left armpit , left peck , and left rib cage . Tongue started to get better as well . Stool started to become more brown and solid . 3/18 On my left inner elbow there was still a purple and red bruise from the blown vein from the nurse in the ER and there were now 2 red spots that were new , next to the huge bruise that I had . There was no real pain , swelling , or heat coming from it except at night it'd get burning and shooting pains and pins and needles down my left forearm into my hand that would wake me up ever 30mins all night . I'd go back to sleep and it would repeat . The bruise and purple areas are still present now . 3/31 . I got prescribed cephalexin 250mg 3 times a day for 7 days for possible cellulitis . Stomach was not upset anymore . No more mucus . I was about 80 % back to where I was before . Started to add more things back to my diet like blueberries , avocado , spinach , almond milk , smoothies . It didn't look jet black but it was darker than dark brown . I started to get very anxious and that's when my stomach went bad again . Never had a black stool after that so maybe it was from the smoothies ? No associated pain or anything with that stool or any after . 3/26- 3/29 Same as before . Stomach would get upset right after I would eat . Feel like a gnawing / burning of my stomach right below my ribs on my left side . I am still able to eat and everything but it just sucks right after . I usually poop 30mins after I eat . I now fluctuate between 158-161 lbs for my weight . 3/30 Throughout the day I feel like I had pruritis . I was itchy throughout my body but not like crazy itchy , just a little itchy and that went away after like 2 hours . Ate a lot of quinoa with both my lunch and dinner and a lot of egg whites with breakfast and dinner . I got a plastic fork and broke the stool apart and inside was brown / yellow , fluffy stool that has become my normal . Once again , no associated pain or anything . 3/31 I woke up and went to the bathroom and had a few more thumb sized poops that were brown / yellow and had very little white , web like , coating on it . I then pooped again 2-3 hrs later and it was fluffy brown / yellow poops again , no white . I still have white on my tongue although it is getting better now that I brush my teeth twice a day with toothpaste , and another brush with baking soda . I wash my mouth with baking soda 3 times a day . And I scrape my tongue 3 times a day . That is where I am today . Tests : November 2020 EKG was normal Normal labs to establish my PCP and haven't had labs done in years . Everything completely within range except : - Cholesterol / HDL Ratio was high : Nov - 5. It was 3 thumb sized solid dark brown poops . Symptoms : Anxiety / Stress : - Heath anxiety , stress with work , moving , relationship problems , etc . currently seeing a psychologist to help get it under control . Bowel movements : - Yellow - Brown - One really dark / possibly black stool but no red blood that I've seen - One white spider web stool but the inside was brown / yellow and fluffy - Undigested foods sometimes but I also eat quinoa and nuts that won't be digested completely if at all - Soft - Fluffy ( breaks apart instantly after touching the water ) - Some float and some sink - Foul smelling ( not so much anymore but still present sometimes ) - Yellow / white transparent Mucus ( not so much anymore but still present sometimes ) - Poop 2-5 times a day depending on how my stomach feels that day - A little stool when I wake up at 6am , usually a lot of stool around 8 or 9 ( 30mins after I eat ) , and a little stool after dinner or right before I go to bed around 10pm . Stomach : - Very rare nausea - Very rare bloating - Never vomiting - Never any real pain - More than normal gas - More than normal burping - Gnawing / burning under left rib cage - Stomach feel better when empty - Hunger pangs even though I'm not hungry - Somewhat loss of appetite but could be anxiety due to past experiences when I eat - I eat a lot less than I use to and feel full much faster - Uneasy feeling sometimes when I wake up , mainly right after meals Body : - Pruritis once - No jaundice - A little bit dryer skin - More red eyes - This blown vein bruise that hasn't gone away in almost a month now - Weird aches ( feels like swollen lymph nodes ) mainly down my left armpit , peck , and ribs . A little on the right side as well but not nearly what the left side is . Chest and armpits show no visible swelling and does not hurt to the touch . Maybe sometimes a little tender but not at all bad . - A very weird burning sensation ( feels like a pinched nerve ) on my middle left shoulder blade that feels like it was spreading to to my left lat muscle , where the weird lymph aches were . - 2 nights in a row recently I had night sweats unrelated to anything . No covid and too long after the covid vaccine . - Heart palpitations that would wake me up ( when I was dehydrated ) Mouth : - What appears to be oral thrush . White / yellow tongue that I can scrape off but comes back . - Every morning I spit out yellow . - A lot of bigger white spots on the back of my tongue and little white spots all throughout my tongue . - It's hard to describe , but my tongue looks sort of hair , but not at all like what you see what black hair tongue . - Had one sore on my cheek that bleed and then healed and is gone - Breath that smells similar to my stools Medications : - Fluconazole 250mg once a day for 12 days ( finished ) - Liquid Nystatin 500,000 units once a day for 7 days ( finished ) - Nystatin tablets 100,000 units once a day for 7 days ( finished ) - Cephalexin 250mg three times a day for 7 days ( finished ) - Montelukast ( don't remember the dosage ) stopped taking it after 2-3 days , suicidal thoughts and insomnia - Pulmicort ( don't remember the dosage ) three times a day , made shortness of breath worse and gave me thrush - Proair Albuterol inhaler ( don't remember the dosage ) as needed but haven't used in over a month , before all of this happened - Antacids ( Tums ) as needed but haven't used in 3 weeks - Hydroxyzine 25mg as needed for when I have or feel anxiety coming , haven't taken in 2-3 weeks - Vitamin D supplement ( don't remember the dosage , 1000units ? ) once a day - Have been prescribed cipro during when I had thrush but haven't taken it because if this is candida , it will make everything worse - Bought SF722 250mg for candida , L-Glutamine 600mg for leaky gut , and NAC for biofilm buster / detox for liver support but I haven't started taking any of this because I have no true confirmation that the white tongue is thrush and what is in my gut is thrush . Diet : My diet is great and healthy and I've been doing this for 3 weeks now , when my stomach was getting better and still now when it is not well . - Do not take any stimulants or drink coffee / energy drinks / tea - No pre existing conditions except maybe some heartburn / gerd randomly throughout the years . Not associated with any type of food or anything , just had heartburn / acid reflux here and there . - No prior bowel problems besides diarrhea once every couple of months usually from something I ate that my stomach didn't agree with . After the diarrhea my stools and stomach return to completely normal . - Not very active but prior I would golf every weekend and I walk a decent amount for work but I also sit around a lot - Got covid on December 9th and was still testing positive until January 15th . I had a 99 degree “ fever ” , a very slight cough , 1 night of chills , a couple hours of shortness of breath , and a tickle in my throat . I was symptom free and completely fine by December 11th . But I tested positive every week for 5 weeks and had no shortness of breath until Mid to late January which is why I started all the inhalers and asthma meds . It was more home cooked meals ( 4-5 days a week ) than fast food ( 2-3 days ) . If you all have any ideas or have similar instances , please let me know , it will be much appreciated ! I don't want to say it's ruining my life , but it's making everything so much more difficult . The health anxiety sucks and just my overall feeling is sub par ! I apologize for the TL ;D R ! Thank you all and I hope you all have a great rest of your day ! :grinning_face:\",\n",

Anyway I got a battery of blood tests that popped up all kinds of screwy stuff but then she took one look at my lung X-ray and asked if I was a heavy smoker ! I told her I wasn't and that I had SOB and almost asthmatic chest itchiness and tightness in March when I first started showing symptoms but that since then most of it had cleared up . She said my lungs looked like a smoker's , that there was no mucus but inflammation / irritation ( or something like that ) and that I should do a breath spirometer test to check my lung strength . It's frustrating that she doesn't want to touch the covid issue but I'm pretty resigned to it . I guess I'm just wondering if having inflamed / irritated / smoker lungs ( and I have xrays from 2009-2017 to show that they weren't always bad ) would be a sign that this was covid all along and my lungs have taken a hit from it ?

My lingering symptoms are mostly GI related and they suck , but most of my symptoms are improving if not completely gone . My blood pressure is still high . I'm on a very low dose beta blocker that keeps my heart rate consistantly low , but it hasn't done much for my blood pressure so my doctor is having me start a low dose ace inhibitor to see if that will work .

I slept for 7 hours straight today for the first time in about a month and I feel great . Still having some aches and pains but this too is improved . I highly recommend seeing your doctor about your symptoms if you're long hauling . Most of the stuff they can't help you with but somethings they can . Limited spicy foods . Exercise and Mental exertion None until very recently I rested hard . Slowly worked my way up . Even cut out mental stimuli that was too intensive like FPS video games and new tv shows for a while . Listened to podcasts , rewatched familiar tv shows and movies , and played very basic kids games like battle for bikini bottom remastered . Slowly worked up to more mentally taxing forms of entertainment and now I'm working on physical exercise . Think I'm going to start incorporating mild strength training this week . I was lifting 6 days a week before i got sick but I'm going to only try 2-3 days this week . Everything but my thyroid came back normal .

I just learned about CFS last year and finally switched to a Physician that knows about it . I always believed my fatigue was from severe depression but learning more has me thinking it is physical . We're still trying to rule out what I could be dealing with but I think I already know based on comparing my story and symptoms to others . The fatigue was bearable for the most part but then in September 2020 I got COVID - 19 . I didn't need to be hospitalized but I had pretty much every symptom . I thought I would recover quickly but the fatigue and PEM have gotten worse along with brain fog and body aches every day . So I'm about a 4 month long hauler with susceptibility to being worse after covid I think . It is so difficult to reach your potential in college when you are to tired to move . I've felt like giving up so many days . They are very busy day to day so I never feel like I can really sit down and talk to them seriously about it . I've stopped saying the phrase “ I'm tired ” because then someone's automatic response is “ me too , I worked all day ” . And I just can't ever explain to them how I am not able to work a job because my memory is so unclear and I have to lay down 20 + hours a day .

       " \" Starting from the beginning , ( the initial infection ) the day before i tested positive with covid i was on a walk and suddenly my sides begin to squeeze in super tight and i almost lost conciseness , fearing for my life i called an ambulance and was brought to the er . they tested me for covid and it came up negative and found nothing and said that it was probably a episode of gastritis , a stomach lining issue i overcame maybe a few weeks earlier . this time to a walk in clinic where they took urine and blood test , all which showed up perfect , but then the doctor told me i had tested positive for covid , it felt like a train hit me in that moment . i went home and that same night was hit with cold sweats and wierd sensations in my body . the following days i experienced weird sensations ( waves through body , random pains around body and head ) and my eyesight felt off . but other than that felt ok , and the infection period felt more mental than physical . post infection - around the end of covid , i was up one night and was checking my hr and oxy finger thing , the typical covid routine . and my hr was constantly bouncing from 120 to 145 , i was confused and concerned how this changed so quick so i went to the walk in clinic the next day and was immediately told to go to the er , so i did . the next day , boom . heart palpations that felt more like a kick than a flutter . but , knowing i cant afford more er trips i shrugged it off . soon after i completed my move out of town with my girlfriend and felt great , the first few weeks after covid is the last time i remember feeling normal . shorty after moving in i woke up one morning and my vision was worse , i felt a million miles away , and i couldnt think of a thought if it wasnt about me dying . two er trips later , incuding multiple blood test , ekg's , and a ct scan and im still unanswered exept anxiety and stress . blood work came up normal , but showed signs of prediabities ( i ate fast food almost everyday as my dad brought it home from work for dinner so i wasnt suprised ) . now - two months in now , and i dont know how to function anymore . i always feel like im minutes away from dying , constany fighting with my gf because she thinks im lazy and downplays my condition . new or worsening symptoms everyday including my eyesight . i will list all my current symptoms here : eyesight worsening , chest pain mostly on left side , chest discomfort , heart palpitations , limb pain , chest feels like it has a ball in it when im laying down on it , foamy urine but my urine test showed no kidney disfunction , no appetite or thirst , ear aches , cold sweats , side pains , groin pains , random pins and needles throughout body , needle poking me pain around body , loss of hearing , spasms or pulsing feelings just about anywhere ( neck , temples , legs , stomach , lips , arms ) you name it it pulses . i cant rest sice i have a child and im under constant pressure to go back to work . i have moments in the day where i swear im about to die , where my eyes dull , my chest hurts , im exausted , and i lose balance . im constanly worrying that this is something else and its gonna kill me in my sleep or randomly . tbh honest im terrified i know my body and this isnt it . i cant be alone or get in a car because im worried of something happening and nobody can help , or seeing family so i dont get a flu and die . this is the most deppressing and long thing ive ever dealt with . i miss the old me so much , but it feels like ill never see him again \",\n",

       " 'Did 9/10 HBOT treatments , felt 95 % better but then over exerted myself I first got sick with Covid on March 28 of this year . I am vaccinated and boosted with the Pfizer vaccine . I was a very healthy person before Covid , doing intense workouts 4-6 days a week , eating very healthy , drinking only socially , not a drug user , no pre-existing conditions . This has been my lifestyle for years ( except for the occasional wild night out of drinking a few times a year ) . But because I am under 65 , vaccinated , and healthy , they would not give it to me , no matter how much I explained my intense suffering . One doctor told me my risk of death was low , so I would be fine . I thought this was ridiculous--that I should be made to suffer because I did the right things in life by living a healthy lifestyle and being vaccinated--but I was prepared to just tough it out . Then when my worse symptoms subsided after a week , I was shocked that I had no energy to get out of bed . My heart felt crazy when I tried to sit up . My head was \" swimming \" even sitting up a little bit . \" I could not stand up for more than two minutes without dizzyness and a sweeping nausea overtaking me . I had on-and-off pins and needles ranging to actual pain in my extremities . I was not sleeping through the night . From this reddit I learned that I likely had POTS , nerve damage , and dysautonomia , at the very least . After the third week of this , and doing research here and reading other forums , I realized going to a doctor was not going to help much . I started taking antihistamines , lumbrokinase , quercetin , NAC , lion\\'s mane , and an olive leaf extract in addition to the many other supplements I already take daily . The antihistamines immediately made me able to sit up and function a little better , but I still had very low energy , POTS , and could not do much without having to rest for 2-3 hours . I rarely left my apartment . I actually moved a lot of the heavy equipment as part of my returns myself for various logistical reasons . I just wanted to see if I really was a strong and rugged as I was before . I thought I was just testing myself . Right now , I am back in bed again . I do not feel as bad as I did before my treatments , but for the first two days that I have been resting , I think I was back to 50 % . Body aches and pains . Dizzyness upon sitting up just a little . Zero desire to move . I actually doubled my antihistamines to twice a day , up from once , following the protocol I have seen on other posts . I am so afraid of totally backsliding . I took an at home Covid test and it is negative . I feel a little better today after three days of pretty much total bed rest . But it just shocks me how not back to normal I am . That I could feel so healed , then do something that I could easily have done two months ago , and be wiped out , really brought it home to be that I have to be careful with my body for the time being . I know that my long Covid experience has been mild compared to what so many of you are going through , but I want you to know that sharing your stories is what made me seek the most aggressive treatment possible as soon as possible . It helped me make the effort to take care of myself . I am lucky enough that I can go back to HBOT , and I hope that it has a healing effect this time . I have read that treatments have run from as little as five to as many as 10-15 for Covid , to some going all the way to 60 for long haulers . I only had LH symptoms for two weeks . I can imagine that if you have had them for months or years , more treatments would be necessary to make a lasting difference ',\n",

Mild case of covid , recovered after about 6 days , felt tired for a while after but nothing crazy . Started to develop chest pain and heart palps . Just kinda ignored it until I almost fainted climbing stairs at work one day , HR jumped to 150 scared me , whole ordeal . Same old story as most ER ran tests everything came back fine , even ultrasound on my heart , no inflammation detected . Had an appointment with my GP and she said its long covid and theres not a lot to do just wait it out and come back if I don't feel better after a few months . My main symptoms were just elevated heart rate upon standing and exercise intolerance . I kept working ( construction ) and would just pass out after work from exhaustion but eventually that went away along with the anxiety attacks and constant chest pain . I honesty didn't have serious long covid compared to most here . And now about 3 months in I feel mostly like myself again . I still haven't gone back to working out and running I'm pretty scared of a relapse . My only symptom now is occasionally I still have episodes of a few days of elevated HR . On a good day when I feel recovered my resting HR is around 62 and when i stand it hovers around 70-75 on a day when i fell super sick ill wake up and my HR will be around 65 but when i stand it jumps to 100ish and will hover there unless i lay flat on my back again then it immediately comes back down to around 67 . What is this and how do i tell my doctor when i go back next week so that i don't get told just wait it out ?

I might not get what you have . You'll get there . I still have lingering symptoms such as Covid tongue ( should anyone have any useful idea to resolve this , please share with me ) or parosmia . But 3 months after being infected , I'm on my way and expect to make a full recovery . And I'm positive you will , too . * * Day 1 - 19 Dec : * * Mild coughing and runny nose , rapid self-test comes back with a very pale T line so I repeat it . The same result for the second time . I decide this to be positive and report it to the NHS and start self-isolation . * * Day 2 - 20 Dec : * * Mild coughing in the morning , condition gets better by the evening . * * Day 3 - 21 Dec : * * Getting out of bed only after a few hours of sleeping . My heart is racing and can't breathe normally for minutes , or at least it feels like . Oxygen saturation is 98 % however , despite the feeling I can't breathe . I spend the rest of the day with recovering , no other symptoms other than a bit of cough and a lot of sneezing . The mandatory PCR test that I ordered after the positive self-test on Sunday , arrives . * * Day 4 - 22 Dec : * * Feeling better , mild cough , a bit of sneezing and dry nose is all . * * Day 5 - 23 Dec : * * Feeling nearly 100 % again , have a dry nose and a bit of sneezing , my smell is not lost but gets slightly off by the evening . Cracker tastes a bit funny but no other change in taste . Getting very dehydrated but can't even drink much , only sip . Brainfog , tiredness , disorientation . Speaking makes me running out of breath instantly and makes coughing worse . Toothpaste tastes like ash . * * Day 7 - 25 Dec : * * Waking up with completely dry sinuses , swollen lips , tongue is completely covered with some white film that doesn't come off after brushing . Seems like oral thrush . Still don't have appetite , can't eat more than just a few bits all day , and can only sip water . Mild pain in the chest appears , brainfog , tiredness , disorientation continues . Getting out of the bed to visit the bathroom a few metres away pushes my pulse up to 115 . Speaking makes me running out of breath instantly and makes coughing worse . Toothpaste tastes like ash . * * Day 8 - 26 Dec : * * Same issues as the day before , can't eat or drink properly for nearly 3 days now . Brainfog , tiredness , disorientation , sky-high pulse when getting out of bed or standing up from chair . Chest pain gets worse . Calling 111 to report about increasing chest pain and being severely dehydrated . The operator decides to send ambulance . All my values look good again . Chest pain is likely due to continues coughing , I'm told . Forcing myself to drink 2 full glasses of water and eating a bowl of soup . Condition seems to improve for a few hours with no symptoms other than occasional cough by the evening . Speaking makes me running out of breath instantly and makes coughing worse . Toothpaste tastes like ash . Hoarse voice when talking . * * Day 9 - 27 Dec : * * Waking up early and slightly confused , but my pulse is below 100 at least . Forcing myself for hours to fall asleep again before I finally manage it . Getting out of bed at noon after a wake up call from family . Speaking makes me running out of breath , coughing . Condition seems to improve for a few hours again with no symptoms whatsoever other than occasional cough . Hoarse voice when talking . Toothpaste taste improved but not quite there yet . * * Day 10 - 28 Dec : * * Waking up with sky-high pulse again , out of breath . Oximeter is acting up , seems to have some sort of mechanical problem . Still don't have any appetite , but unfortunately have brainfog and slight dizzinesss . Spending the night on the couch in a weird half lying - half sitting position to maintain higher level of oxygen saturation and prevent congested nose . * * Day 11 - 29 Dec : * * Getting up in the morning with slightly elevated pulse but can breath normally , unlike in the last few days . Mouth is still dry a bit but not as bad as it was . As self-isolation is over , wert out to get vitamins , magnesium , fruits high in vitamin C . Spending a bit more than an hour outside , walking in a somewhat slowed pace but no issues with breathing or palpitations . Feels like a definite improvement in my condition after the last few days . Some food still tastes and smells a bit funny though , but hopefully it will get better later down the road . * * Day 12 - 30 Dec : * * Got up with almost normal pulse and could breath easily . I'm now positive the healing has started . Had a fairly normal day , a bit tired than usually but this is part of the recovery process I guess . Been walking 4 kms in an hour which is only slightly slower than my normal pace . Appetite returned , ate twice . Taste and smell is still off a bit , but it seems to be improving overall . * * Day 13 - 31 Dec : * * Mild coughing when talking , no other symptoms to report . Taste and smell is still off a bit , but it seems to be improving overall . Coughing got heavier by the evening . * * Day 14 - 1 Jan : * * Pulse is too high again , around 90 during resting . Intense cough even when not talking . Diarreha , nausea all day . No appetite , have to force myself to drink . * * Day 15 - 2 Jan : * * A fairly normal day with very mild symptoms , hoping to be on the way to full recovery . * * Day 16 - 3 Jan : * * Pulse is too high again , around 90 during resting . Coughing when getting out of bed . Trying to stay hydrated by drinking water , tea and ORS , eating soup . * * Day 17 - 4 Jan : * * Pulse is above 100 when resting . In the afternoon I decide to simply make my way to the GP without an appointment . Strolling for 10 minutes spikes my pulse up to 135 . Getting seated immediately and seen by my GP ( first encounter ever , we have only talked on the phone once , a few months before in a different matter ) . She quickly examines me an recommends to call a cab while she writes a referral to A & E . Spending a few hours there ( repeated blood test is needed for whatever reason ) , my values seems to be good and my pulse drops around 80 for the first time in days ( my normal resting value is around 60-65 ) . Getting dismissed at the end of the day , diagnosis is hypophosphatemia , ie serum phosphate level being too low , likely owing to involuntary fasting in the last few days - completely lost appetite . At least my pulse is back to the normal 65-75 range when resting . * * Day 19 - 6 Jan : * * Experiencing hypothermia for like 2 hours , my body temperature is around 34. * * Day 20 - 7 Jan : * * Feeling very exhuasted , pulse is in the 65-75 range when resting . Bad cough , even when resting . Brain fog , mild headache , confusion , but no breathing difficulties at least . I have no appetite at all despite my stomach is growling . Forcing myself to eat , thankfully it stays down . * * Day 21 - 8 Jan : * * A fairly normal day with normal pulse range and no significant symtoms . Still a bit slower when walking and thinking and lose focus easily . * * Day 22 - 9 Jan : * * A fairly normal day with normal pulse range and no significant symtoms . Still a bit slower when walking and thinking and lose focus easily . * * Day 23 - 10 Jan : * * A fairly normal day with normal pulse range and no significant symtoms . Still a bit slower when walking and thinking and lose focus easily . Speaking induces heavy cough . * * Day 24 - 11 Jan : * * A fairly normal day with normal pulse range and no significant symtoms . Still a bit slower when walking and thinking and lose focus easily . Experiencing some palpitations and slight shortness of breath in the evening . * * Day 25 - 12 Jan : * * Palpitations and shortness of breath continued from the previous evening , taking a few hours off mid-day and go back to bed to recover somewhat . Still a bit slower when walking and thinking and lose focus easily . Speaking induces heavy cough . * * Day 27 - 14 Jan : * * A fairly normal day with normal pulse range and no significant symtoms . Still a bit slower when walking and thinking and lose focus easily . Speaking induces heavy cough , pulse also gets up in the evening . * * Day 28 - 15 Jan : * * Heart rate jumps up and goes back down all day . Ice cold right leg and foot when in bed , it improves slightly when taking a short walk outside . Heavy coughing . Occasional short of breath . Ice cold right leg and foot when in bed , it improves slightly when taking a short walk outside . Heavy coughing . * * Day 30 - 17 Jan : * * Lips , tongue and mouth gets very dry in the evening despite drinking all day . This is a symptom that i have for weeks now , there was some improvement but it seems to fall back now again . Leg is pretty bad , deciding to get to the hospital where they confirm that the circulation in my right leg / foot is indeed seems to be worse than in the left one . Spending the whole day there , going through blood / urine tests , ECG , blood pressure , lung X-ray . They find nothing alarming , not even signs of dehydration despite my constantly dry mouth . Getting prescribed Nystan for the Covid tongue to use for a week as they suspect oral thrush . * * Day 31 - 18 Jan : * * Getting up with a slight headache and dry lips , tongue , mouth . It gets better by the day . Leg pain improves a bit but not much . All in all , a fairly normal day with some occasional cough . In the evening my temperature rises again to above 37C . * * Day 32 - 19 Jan : * * A fairly normal day with pulse in the normal range and no significant symtoms . Occasional cough and dry sinuses . Covid tongue improves somewhat . Leg still hurts but the pain is milder than it was . * * Day 33 - 20 Jan : * * A fairly normal day with pulse in the normal range and no significant symtoms . Occasional cough and dry sinuses . Occasional cough and dry sinuses . Further improvements to Covid tongue and leg . * * Day 35 - 22 Jan : * * A fairly normal day with pulse in the normal range and no significant symtoms . Occasional cough and dry sinuses . Barely any cough . Further improvements to Covid tongue and leg . Stopped using Nystan after a week . There seem to be some improvement but it didn't resolve the problem completely . * * Day 39 - 26 Jan : * * High pulse throughout the day ( over 100 when sitting / lying in the bed ) and heavy coughing . Very dry mouth and lips , drinking all day and peeing like 15X times . Got an appointment for a DVT leg scan in the evening , it confirms there is no sign of blood clots in either leg , hence the reason for the cold / painful leg remains unknown . Heading to the hospital afterwards but pulse drops to around 80 whilst there ( my normal resting range is 60-65 ) and ECG looks good as well so i'm sent home without any useful advice or treatment . ' Post covid , deal with it ' . I'm getting prescribed Nystan again to treat my Covid tongue , but this time for 3 days only . * * Day 40 - 27 Jan : * * A fairly normal day apart from heavy cough and slightly elevated pulse in the morning that got better throughout the day . * * Day 41 - 28 Jan : * * Racing heartbeat throughout the day and very heavy cough when talking . Managed to speak to my GP over the phone , amidst wheezing and coughing . She prescribed an inhaler and antibiotics to help with the cough , as well as Sudafed for the nose that feels congested . Gets slightly better by the afternoon . Coughing improves , too . * * Day 44 - 31 Jan : * * Racing heartbeat in the first half of the day , but surprisingly , it slows down to the 60s later . Even my blood pressure drops to around 110/75 . Feeling disoriented , dizzy . Coughing improves further . * * Day 45 - 1 Feb : * * Experiencing high pulse as I'm getting out of the bed , gets somewhat better throughout the day . Having troubles with focusing . * * Day 46 - 2 Feb : * * High pulse when wake up . It gets better during the day.Having a bad , pulsing headache , dizziness , problems with focusing and the feeling of occasional shortness of breath despite oxygen levels seems to be in the 94-99 % range . Feeling weak in the legs . * * Day 47 - 3 Feb : * * A pretty awful headache all day . Feeling winded , even though my oxygen saturation seems to be normal . Reached out to another GP in the evening , he recommended stop using the inhaler as I suspect that makes me lightheaded . Got a face to face visit for the next week to get my headaches and coughing checked . * * Day 48 - 4 Feb : * * A fairly normal day with good mood and some coughing , until the evening hours when getting a pretty bad headache that lasts for hours , accompanied by dry mouth and lips . * * Day 49 - 5 Feb : * * Getting up with a mild headache that gradually gets better by the day . Experiencing some dizziness when taking a walk in the nearby park but other than that , not much to worry about . * * Day 50 - 6 Feb : * * A fairly normal day with some cough and occasional dry mouth and lips . Still experiencing the imbalance when walking . Heart rate still goes up around 30-35 when getting out of the bed in the morning , but it calms down in a few mins and does not appear during the day for roughly a week now . * * Day 51 - 7 Feb : * * A fairly normal day with some cough and occasional dry mouth and lips .

Heart rate still goes up around 30-35 when getting out of the bed in the morning , but it calms down in a few mins and does not appear during the day for roughly a week now . * * Day 53 - 9 Feb : * * A fairly normal day with occasional dry mouth and occasional sensivity to sound with a pulsating feeling in the ears / head . GP told me to get steroid nasal spray and as well as a spray for dry mouth . Got my ear examined , nothing shows so the imbalance I experience is likely due to nerve damages which will recover at some point . * * Day 54 - 10 Feb : * * Received the 24h Holter monitor attached on me in the hospital so they can examine my ECG for a full day . Have spent probably the most relaxed day for weeks with barely any palpitations throughout . Occasional dry mouth and lips is still a thing though . * * Day 55 - 11 Feb : * * Returned the monitor to the hospital , evaluation to take 6-8 weeks . Not many symptoms I can report other than the usual occasional dry mouth and lips . Covid tongue seemed to improve in the past days but now it is relapsing . * * Day 56 - 12 Feb : * * A fairly normal day with a pretty bad headache in the evening . Even though I had no problem with this so far , can't taste mouthwash all of a sudden ( the smell of it has been off for a while , sometimes it smells normal , other times it isn't - seems to be parosmia ) . * * Day 57 - 13 Feb : * * A fairly normal day until the evening when a severe chest tightness makes me cough and elevates my pulse . Ending up heading to A & E . ECG , chest X-ray , all looks good . Blood result as well with the exception of D Dimer which is higher than it was on the last occasion . Being told that they'll be in touch to organize an ultrasound scan for my legs in search of possible blood clots , despite I had this scan privately just a few weeks ago and that came back negative . * * Day 58 - 14 Feb : * * A pretty normal day with occasional palpitations and bad cough in the first half that improves by the evening . * * Day 59 - 15 Feb : * * Got called from the hospital due to my recent A & E visit test results . Went in again and had my blood drown . Tests are looking okay this time , oxygen , blood pressure as well . * * Day 60 - 16 Feb : * * Nasal spray didn't help too much today with the inflammed blood vessels in the nose . I have been lightheaded and tired all day and had vertigo . * * Day 61 - 17 Feb : * * I have been lightheaded and tired all day and had vertigo . Visited a private cardiologist in the evening for echocardiogram , results came back normal . * * Day 62 - 18 Feb : * * I have been lightheaded and tired all day and had vertigo .

Pain in the tummy , mostly around the gallbladder ( been diagnosed with a gallstone end of last year , before got infected with Covid ) . Barely any appetite throughout the day . Reflux-like symptoms in the evening . * * Day 67 - 23 Feb : * * Getting out of bed , pulse is close to 90 , shaking . It gets better a few hours later . * * Day 68 - 24 Feb : * * A fairly good day with some cough and slight shortness of breath in the afternoon and mild tinnitus in the evening . * * Day 69 - 25 Feb : * * A fairly normal day with some cough and occasional mild vertigo when walking around . * * Day 72 - 28 Feb : * * A fairly normal morning that got worse all of a sudden in the afternoon with heavy breathing for a few hours .

Slight vertigo when walking . * * Day 75 - 3 Mar : * * Pinkish sputum in the morning . Called the GP , she said it could be caused by irritation of the nose or throat .

Nose feels a bit congested so I can breathe mostly through my mouth only . Covid tongue seems to improve a bit . * * Day 77 - 5 Mar : * * A fairly normal day with some cough . Nose feels a bit congested so I can breathe mostly through my mouth only . Covid tongue seems to improve a bit . * * Day 78 - 6 Mar : * * A fairly normal day with some cough . Nose feels a bit congested so I can breathe mostly through my mouth only . Covid tongue looks pretty bad again . Went to see the ENT in the evening who confirmed inflammed nose through endoscopy ( hypertrophy of the turbinates ) and ordered a blood test as well as CT scan and audiology examination . Got prescribed Betnesol nasal drops to use for a month . I've been told that pinkish sputum in the morning might be scary but probably not life threatening as it could be a sign of upper respiratory tract infection and not a more serious medical condition . * * Day 84 - 12 Mar : * * A fairly normal day with no significant symtoms other than pinkish sputum in the morning . * * Day 85 - 13 Mar : * * Blood in sputum turns red from the previous pink - no other symptoms to report . * * Day 86 - 14 Mar : * * As every day in the past weeks , morning starts with splitting blood . ENT described it could come from anywhere , most probably is present because of the long lasting upper respiratory infection , but we'll know more once the CT is evaluated . Feeling a bit weird in the morning , nausea , slight disorientation . Condition gets better by the afternoon , but coughing is present again after days of not having such problem . * * Day 87 - 15 Mar : * * Got up with a headache and blocked nose but having a fairly normal day with some coughing again . * * Day 88 - 16 Mar : * * Got up with a headache and blocked nose but having a fairly normal day with some coughing again . * * Day 89 - 17 Mar : * * Getting up in the middle of the night due to blocked airways , had to apply nasal drops to be able to fall asleep again .

Hypertrophy of the turbinates does not seem to improve despite using nasal drops for 2 weeks , 3 times a day . Covid tongue is still with me and at this point i'm pretty much hopeless whether it will ever resolve . Got pretty dizzy in the evening for hours and an had an awful headache . * * Day 96 - 24 Mar : * * Waking up to a terrible vertigo , the whole world was spinning . Phoned 111 and a few hours later I picked up the prescribed Cyclizine from my local pharmacy . No other symptoms to report other than tinnitus and heavy and moderate episodes of vertigo all day . * * Day 97 - 25 Mar : * * A fairly normal day wiht slight dizziness . Covid tongue worsens again . He also prescribed a nose spray to take if neccessary once I'm done with the drops . * * Day 101 - 29 Mar : * * A fairly normal day with slight dizziness \",\n",

This is a rant , but I'm a 16F , 17 in ten days , I was positive for covid a bit ago and since then I've been in the worst battle with my body and mainly my mental health . ( Possibly could be more but I've never been diagnosed because it never kept me from enjoying life ) . Let's start from the beginning where I was first extremely sick out of no where , I thought that I had the flu until I went in and was tested positive for covid , I was coughing harshly , dizzy , couldn't eat anything besides baby type foods like apple sauce and sometimes protein drinks and sometimes water , I was constantly in bed . I started getting the worst anxiety and kept having panic attacks on top of panic attacks and then was sent into dpdr for a few days with more constant anxiety . A few days later I finally started eating actual food , and honestly started to feel a bit better besides the still constant anxiety but luckily wasn't as bad still , recently my symptoms have fallen again .. I have this constant migraine type pressure in my head on the right side with a little bit of facial tingling . ( I don't believe this is anything bad because it's been a few days with it with only the tingling but no other symptoms to worry about ) . My heart feels like it's constantly beating out of my chest and my eyesight has been so sensitive since the beginning and any sharp loud noises make me flinch . Im truly exhausted and constantly frustrated . In the end I still truly enjoy life and all it's pleasures but what is there for me to do now ? I still have so much of life left for me but I just simply don't know how to continue as the same person \",\n",

       " \"Long Hauler ? Extreme Brain Fog and Headaches Last May 2020 I suddenly felt extremely sick in the strangest way . I was weak , dizzy , lightheaded , had neck and jaw pain , general malaise , disoriented , confused and developed a pretty bad headache that would bounce back and fourth from all around head pain to a stabbing pain under my right eye . After a week of having the headache nonstop I went to the ER where they didn't test me for covid because I didn't have respiratory symptoms and they believed covid symptoms were only respiratory at the time . They did an MRI and CT which came out normal and then they discharged me . A few days later I still had the headache and developed a cough and sore throat . I never got tested because I assumed if the hospital thought I had covid they would have tested me before putting me in a room with old people and other at risk people . Obviously I regret this now . The headache never fully went away so I've had a continuous headache on and off for almost a year , I am dizzy , extremely fatigued , neck pain , jaw pain , intolerance to exercise , intolerance to alcohol , I feel disoriented , derealization and almost out of body . I realized that a lot of my friends who had covid only have neurological symptoms and when I looked into long haulers so many people seem to be experiencing the same symptoms as me . It has been so hard for me to work . I just ordered a T-cell test that I dropped $ 200 on so I'm hopping I get some answers with that . I have been struggling so hard to stay positive because I feel like I'm stuck like this and I'm not longer myself \",\n",

       " \" While I know a lot of you are probably sick of seeing vaccine posts on here , I felt it was important to share my story as it's a bit different than most . I've been a long hauler since July of 2020 ( about 10 months ) . My lasting symptoms were almost solely gastrointestinal ; greenish diarrhea / loose stool with associated intense lower abdominal pain and strong acid reflux . The only non-GI symptoms I've experienced were all skin related , hives / itching / rashes . I've had a colonoscopy and an endoscopy with no issues found and UC and Crohn's have been ruled out . Since skin issues were also present , I went to an allergist and was tested for both food allergies / sensitivities and MCAS . Lo and behold , that Friday I woke up without any abdominal pain or urgent need to use the bathroom ( which is what has almost always woken me up every morning for the past 10 months ) . I didn't think much of it and got ready for my day . Early in the afternoon , I started to feel that cramping that usually happens before a bowel movement , but it was surprisingly duller . Usually it was colicky and wrenching , but this time it was dull and slightly crampy . I was even able to stop taking my Bentyl ( a smooth muscle relaxer , only thing that relieved the pain ) . It wasn't until last week that I saw this vaccine-improvement thing being talked about , and when I did , the light bulb in my head went off . That was the only factor that changed when my symptoms improved . Has anyone else had a similar experience ? ?\",\n",

Some background : - both my husband and I Tested positive in early January , was fully recovered by mid-Jan ( around the 15th or so ) - My husband developed a cough right before this COVID vaccine on January 22nd , and it's still around today although it's getting better . That is his only longhaul symptom I had complete remission of my symptoms until March 28/29 th . Around that time I started getting migraines more frequently , which I thought was due to hormones but I had one twice in a week which isn't normal for me . I also started to just feel sort of “ out of it ” and irritable for about a week . I blamed this partially on starting meds for anxiety ( which I stopped quickly due to side effects ) , but the feelings still persisted after I stopped taking it . I then had random muscle aches for a few days . THEN I got my first vaccine in 4/6 and that sent me for a loop - horrible muscle aches , body temperature all over the place , congestion , and fatigue . I thought it was all from the vaccine , but those symptoms lasted about 8 days . The fatigue got so bad after 5 days I thought I was going to collapse at work . It's better now but I still have the following symptoms after almost a month of this : - Muscle weakness and pain , specifically back pain - Head pressure - Brain Fog and a general “ out of it ” feeling . Almost like being high and detached . This comes and goes but it's my most frustrating symptom - Constant fatigue - Unrefreshing sleep - chest tightness and tickling - Mild cough - Fatigue after exertion - The “ flu like ” feeling in my head and sinuses I have an appointment on 5/4 with my doctor to talk about any other causes . Who else can relate ? Any words of wisdom or solidarity ? And please don't say anxiety or stress - I've dealt which anxiety a lot before and it's never been like this for me . I've already been gaslighting myself into thinking it's all in my head but my mom brought up the long hauling to me , so here I am hoping for some insight \",\n",

I am trying to figure out what's going on with me and after reading through this sub I suspect that I might have had covid at some point and didn't know it . I've been feeling off for a couple months , tired , dizzy , brain fog , heart racing suddenly . A few weeks ago I had a really bizarre episode of intense chest pain that radiated to my jaw shoulders and arms , short of breath etc . I talked myself out of going to the hospital for it bc I am generally healthy and thought maybe it was anxiety or indigestion . But then my left leg swelled up like a balloon with pitting edema in my foot so I made an appt to get checked out . They did an ekg and it came back abnormal , tachycardia ( 152 heart rate ) , short PR intervals and my blood pressure was high - ( 168/102 ) which is bizarre bc my bp is usually very very low . They sent me to the cardiologist and the ekg there was the same , now scheduled for a stress test and 24 holter monitor test . I've had blood work done , chest CT scan ( lungs are clear ) and duplex venous ultrasound all normal . I get random palpitations every day now and my heart races and I feel exhausted . My legs and ankles swell periodically . I get dizzy and lightheaded easily , random nausea , and had one episode where I got suddenly weak and confused and my lips went numb . The tips of my fingers and feet also tingle off and on and occasionally go numb . I am so baffled by all of this happening suddenly . I'm 37 and generally healthy . I had the J & J vaccine a month ago , and reported my symptoms but the doctors don't seem to think it's the vaccine .

I went on my first road trip since the pandemic and while driving I felt short of breath . I thought , this is weird but maybe I'm anxious or something ? It persisted so I looked around me wondering , am I climbing in elevation ? It looked like I gained some but nothing drastic , maybe a thousand or two feet over an hour or two which is nothing . Breathing continued to get incrementally worse . Right when I'd hit my breaking point and think , “ this isn't normal , something is going on , why is this happening ” I would always suddenly see an elevation sign and it would all click . At one point I gained a lot of elevation really fast , up to 8k , and it felt like when my Covid was at it's worst . I was honestly scared and my albuterol inhaler did nothing . Is this my life now ? Will I ever be able to hike at high altitudes again ?

When I would eat AIP compliant meals / foods , it did not flare up . It seemed completely resolved by December , so I went back to eating my regular plant-based diet and dropped the super strict AIP . I was feeling good until it came back ( not as intense as it was in April ) and am wondering if anyone has any advice ? My dr said to rest and drink plenty of electrolytes and hopefully things would even out after dose 2 . I'm patiently waiting . Also looking for advice regarding piriformis syndrome ?

And my GP rings me because I've been in my bed falling apart feeling awful physically and mentally . Asked him what we could do now with the long Covid / depression situation since the mental health trust discharged me .

Sure why not . Hes only in his 20s and already had a shitty quality of life beforehand . Really getting close to giving up here . I have good 10-15 minutes randomly then the rest of the day is hell and suffering with the fucking fatigue . Then bless my souls I also have extremely bad sinus aches and eye dryness so anytime I try to use a screen my entire face feels like its on fire and my eyes hurt . I have no pride in battling this disease every day . I see people talking about pushing themselves slowly but how do you do that when you always feel like shit \",\n",

I awoke that day and it felt like someone had kicked me in the head . This was my first encounter with the virus a full two weeks before the standard lung and fever routine . No one believed me but I knew without a doubt I had covid and it was in my brain . The punch drunk feeling hung around for 6 or 7 months after that was honestly got to be really pleasant until further brain injuries occurred . Neurologists and MRIs have not been able to identify the ABIs I have suffered but Neuropsych testing showed dysfunction in line with head trauma . This time its been more like my regular roller coaster . I realized about halfway through that the reason my head had started to hurt again was because I had stopped taking quercetin . I started taking this to help with histamine but I believe my histamine response is under better control but quercetin is also great for neuro inflammation and it seems like mine got worse pretty quickly after stopping this supplement . Since one bioflavonoid for neuroinflammation seems so important . Overall , I'm doing pretty well at the end of 10 days . Was it all because of the paxlovid ? Absolutely not . If I hadn't added the quercetin back in I bet my head would be killing me today . But who knows maybe in the long run this is what I needed to get out of this . I've lost jobs , and friends , and just about every fuck I had left to give but I'm still here . I'll be god damned if I'll ever let this fucking thing kill me .

       " 'Long Haul + Vaccinated Friend + Insomnia I have no political agenda and have no reason to lie about what I\\'m about to describe . Please , I am just looking for any kind of understanding about what has happened to me . I\\'m 32 / F , single , live alone , was extremely physically fit and healthy up until recently . In mid-May 2021 , after keeping my distance from virtually everyone for over a year , I met up with a friend who had been vaccinated in February . In the days after I felt noticeably weaker and began sleeping 10 + hours a night . I had no symptoms of any sort of illness besides sudden extreme weakness and exhaustion . I asked my friend if he was sick and he said no . By June 2021 the exhaustion and weakness intensified , my hair started falling out in handfuls , I stopped being able to digest food normally , and I began to show signs of major inflammation . Trouble breathing , stuffed nose with no drainage , headaches , whole-body soreness , pain , inflamed skin . I also started having trouble sleeping no matter what I took . In July 2021 , all of this got even worse and my ability to sleep was seemingly fully gone . I\\'ve tried massive doses of prescription sleep aids , GABA , phenibut , melatonin , L-tryptophan , ashwagandha , valerian , CBD / THC / CBN , Benedryl , you name it , and nothing will shut my brain down . I started averaging less than 3 hours of sleep a week and having constant panic attacks . No amount of meditation , breathwork , or clean eating has any effect . In August 2021 I started to put together that what I appear to have is long haul covid despite never having any tell-tale signs of coronavirus ( never had a fever , cough , sore throat , or change in taste / smell . ) I\\'ve been told by many that vaccinated people don\\'t \" shed \" and it would be impossible for me to catch the virus from a vaccinated person , but I\\'ve also heard some theorize that it is possible since we were sharing close breathing space . All I know is that I\\'ve had no contact with anyone other than this friend and my body has seemingly lost the ability to sleep and my health kept declining . Last week , out of pure desperation and lack of any other answers I could find , I started the Ivermectin protocol . Within 24 hours I felt a noticeable decrease in inflammation / body pain and within 48 , I was able to fall asleep for 5 hours . Though it does seem to be helping all of my inflammatory side effects , I\\'m still mostly unable to sleep and cannot find anyone who can tell me why or what can be done about this . So far the only thing that helps me sleep is Valium , but I\\'m concerned about addiction , so I can\\'t take more than 1x a week . Please understand I am not on any side here other than the side that is looking for relief . I would have received a vaccination by now if I\\'d not been so debilitatingly ill the last few months , so please do not shame me . I have barely been able to take care of my basic needs let alone leaving my house and have worried that even the common side effects from the v would be more than I could handle in my already extremely weakened state . All l I have is the hope that someone reading this can give me any insight on what is happening or what I can do so that I can sleep normally again . I would sell my soul for one natural night of sleep . I don\\'t know how much longer I can continue this way . I\\'m worried I will die soon just from how little sleep I\\'m getting ',\n",

       " \"New symptoms a year after infection , second vaccine tomorrow , and solidarity Hi guys , First time posting here , but looking for solidarity and support . I have my second Pfizer vaccine tomorrow and so it feels like a good moment to document what's happened over the past year or so . I'm 27F , in the UK , got Covid in early March 2020 - I was sent to A & E by NHS 111 but they refused to test me as I hadn't been abroad . I was ill for a week , then had a lingering cough for another couple of weeks . It wasn't pleasant but just stayed in bed and watched TV ( while everyone else carried on with their lives as normal , and then eventually locked down just after I got better ) . The only strange symptom was the chest tightness , which wasn't like anything I've experienced before . After the cough cleared up I felt completely better , but then in May I had a strange episode of feeling fatigued in the afternoons and getting the chest tightness again , with a headache and chills ( though no temperature ) . It went on for a few days , then went away . I think this happened one more time in 2020 but I didn't think too much of it . My chest was also slightly wheezy when I exercised , throughout the year , but again , I figured it would clear up on its own . Then in April this year I started getting a strange sensation where I felt I couldn't get enough air on just one side of my chest - the side that had been bad during Covid . I was prescribed an inhaler . But shortly afterwards a whole load of other symptoms showed up . I woke up one morning in late May with pain in one leg , a strange , aching heaviness . Then throughout that week I had burning sensations that would move from my arm to the soles of my feet , pain in my joints ( knees , elbows , ankles , wrists , knuckles ) and a tiny patch of numbness on my face , which I wasn't sure if I was making up or not , I was so hyperfocused on the sensation . I have a close family member with MS and started to freak out that that was the cause . Blood tests from the GP all came back clear ( and no Covid antibodies ) and they didn't have much to say about Covid but agreed to refer me to a neurologist because of my family history . After I had the first dose of vaccine in mid-June , the symptoms seemed to go entirely . No idea if it was a coincidence , because the past couple of weeks they seem to have crept back - not as badly this time , mainly just random pains in my joints ( especially hands and ankles ) and the occasional bout of one-sided asthma . It's utterly bizarre , I can't believe it's all linked together but reading all your stories it's all starting to become clearer . I'm waiting to get a date for an MRI scan , which I'm pretty nervous about . During the earlier episode this year I was also finding I was struggling to focus my eyes when I went outside , usually after looking at a screen . I got new glasses and it seemed to solve the issue - but in the past few days the problem has come back again , even though I've got the same glasses . It's a strange feeling , almost like muscle strain . I've just started taking a vitamin B complex and turmeric having read up about anti-inflammatory stuff . Reading all your success stories is really helping and I would appreciate any words of wisdom anyone has , or if anyone can relate to these symptoms ( particularly developing new symptoms such a long time after infection ) . I'm increasingly convinced LH Covid is to blame . I also have OCD which often manifests as health anxiety , so this is a total nightmare in terms of fixating on sensations , googling , etc . I'm sure everyone on this sub feels like it's difficult to switch off from the symptoms , even if they're lucky enough to be mild like mine - any advice on that front much appreciated too . Solidarity to everyone and wish me luck with my second vax !\",\n",

       " \"Recent discovery re : BP and Zyrtec TLDR : Been a mild long-hauler since March 2020 . Just discovered how Zyrtec really helped me with my blood pressure and chest inflammation . A week after my ER visit , went back to my general practitioner and he diagnosed me with double pneumonia . Gave me some inhalers and antibiotics . Also , EKG was abnormal and at the cardiologist appt in May , the chest X-ray and nuclear stress test showed no problems . It took a few more months but eventually I healed up sufficiently well enough to resume my daily routine . But , I cannot say I've ever been back to normal , not like I was prior to my illness . My lingering symptoms include inflammation in my chest , which I'm going to presume is either my lungs or my heart . I'm guessing it's my heart since it only manifests on my left side , just left of center . Since Spring , I've been taking Zyrtec for seasonal allergies . Just recently decided to switch to a plant based diet and try to wean myself off my medications . So , last week I quit taking my daily dose of Zyrtec and over the course of a few days I noticed my chest inflammation act up more ( usually in the evenings ) and my BP readings were somewhat higher than expected ( I failed to check them for a long time because I felt well , so tough to say how much they may have gone up ) . They were around 140/100 . So , two days ago , I took a Zyrtec and about an hour later , chest inflammation subsided and my BP reading was back to normal ( 120/80 ) . Been taking one a day for the past 2 days and have felt great , my BP checks are all normal . Read in a few other posts that some symptoms appear to be histamine related and this checks out for me as my symptoms improved by just taking Zyrtec OTC once a day . Going to try swapping out my nexium for Pepcid to see if that makes any difference . I'm 51M , regular BMI , runner , and in otherwise good health ( except high BP ) prior to Covid \",\n",

Autumn 2021 it was at 78 , and now in 2022 when i was at hospital it was at 99 beats . They did EKG , bloodtests and xray , but nothing was found , everything seemed normal , aside from the minimal heart valve defect , but that was unchanged since earlier visits . the reason i went to hospital was due to heart palpations and faster heart rate . after a control a few weeks later it was at 111 . doctors gave me betablockers , they said it is due to anxiety . Heart rate is still up , even when laying in bed it is around 80-90 , sitting increases it by about 5-7 points and standing sometimes up to 110 , or even 120 just when doing household things . takes a while till it settles down and then hovers around 90 mostly . it felt like bronchitis , bad coughing , dry coughing , fever for few days but then it was over , the coughing and dry throat persisted for a while though . Following days i noticed that i seemed to be more out of breath than usual , had to stop to get myself together again , but dismissed it since i thought this was due to being sick , which could be , since i do not feel out of breath and never did on other trips following that , so i continued to rest for quite some time and never really did anything for months . Few months later , in sommer 2020 i did a little hiking again , since i felt fine and it was quite steep , up a mountain , i noticed that my heart not only beat fast ( which would be expected , but somehow it seems to beat irregular , sometimes faster , then slower as if it ccould not decide how it should work ) , but i just thought it was due to exhaustion and feeling tired somewhat . When i got the results from the doctor it seems my heat rate increased since last year , this made me somewhat suspicious , since covid emerged i always kinda thought it could be possible me and my family had it back then , but officialy covid was not confirmed to be in europe at that time . But what if it was covid ? It could be that covid has been around longer than most people would have guessed ? Could it be that my heart problems is heart damage due to long covid ? Will this get worse ? Could this turn into a cardiomyopathy or heart insufficency ( those are my biggest worries tbh ) I have to say i do not have any other symptoms of long covid , i do not feel tired , not out of breath , no brain fog etc . its just that my heart rate seems to have changed and i am not sure why , but i am suspicious it could be linked to that sickness back in early 2020 . So i am really not sure , is it progressive covid damage ? Are there other reasons that could cause it ? Doctors said anxiety , but even when not thinking about it for hours or even days and then measuring , it comes high .

       " 'I started my bout with long haul covid Good day to all ! New here , was doing a bit of research on long covid and found this page . I would like to share my story . I am a 29 y / o male from Texas with two doses of the moderna vax and recently went to the hospital due to a heart attack . I had previously had a bout with covid in July 2020 but I recovered well and felt no long lasting effects at all . In January of this year my roommate tested positive for Covid and about 3 days later I also started getting the symptoms . I made a recovery of the inital symptoms in about the last week of January . After I thought I had beaten once again ( I also had covid in July 2020 ) I started noticing that my body felt different . I noticed my heartbeat and breathing \" we\\'re off \" in the first week of February . A few days later I drank a redbull and for some reason I could not sleep and felt worried . I spent all night awake . About two days later I had a couple of sips of beer and suddenly I felt light headed and could not concentrate while playing video games . Things were starting to get worse for me as days went by . One afternoon I was just sitting down in my couch watching TV when once again I felt light headed and thought I was going to pass out and notice my heart was beating faster than usual . I started to pace back and forth and went outside to catch some fresh air . I felt a little better but for the next two hours I could not concentrate and all I was thinking was that little episode I just had . My roommate told me that it was anxiety . I never had issues with anxiety my whole life and this was all new to me . As days went by I would keep getting this little anxiety episodes but they would not last long as before . I also started noticing I would get heart palpitations more than usual and as well as feeling fatigue certain days . I started to change my lifestyle by eating healthier , taking multivitamins and exercising . I did this for a week and then Feb . 27 I had a headache the whole day . I woke up to the feeling of the headache once again but regardless I still resume my daily activity of having something to eat and play video games . I went to bed around midnight and fell asleep . I returned to bed and fell asleep right away . When I woke up at noon , I was on my phone when all of a sudden I started to feel that chest pain but this time it hurt a lot more . My arm started to hurt too and quickly got up from my bed and started to do breathing exercises but the pain was too much . I got out of my room and saw my sister and told her I was not feeling good . She believed it was just my headache from the previous day and shrugged it off . I started to cough a little and quickly went on my phone and googled the symptoms quickly and first thing that came up was heart attack . I initially told her doctor and went on our way but the chest pain was something I had never felt before and changed my mind and told her to take me to the hospital . We arrived at the ER and it took about 10 minutes for someone to check my vitals . Doctor quickly said I was too young to be having a heart attack and suggested it might be something to do with acid reflux which I do have a history with . I felt a little calm when he said that and went back to the waiting room for my results to come in . Another Doctor came in a few minutes later and told me that my troponin levels indicated that a heart attack might had happened . I started to cry when I heard this and thought I was minutes away from dying . I no longer felt pain anywhere but I was damn scared and anxious . I spent the night and the next morning I was seen by the doctor . I told her about my medical history ( asthma as a child , fatty liver problems years before and two covid infections ) and the symptoms I felt the day before . Dr told me I would be going a cardiac catherization and if theres any clots that a stent would be inserted . I spent the whole night worried anxious and thought of every possible scenario that could go wrong , I was given more medications that night and started to feel a little better . The next day I was woken up early to be taken to my procedure . I was still a little nervous but I wanted it to get it over with . The procedure was not long but it did hurt . I thought I would be asleep for it but I was given something to make my arm numb but regardless I still felt it . I was taken to the recovery room and then my room an hour later . About two hours later the Dr came by and advised me that no blood clots or plaque was found and everything seemed fine . Dr suggested that all of this was due to Covid and was a residual effect as she explained that I was still 4-6 weeks away from when I had it in January . I did tell her that my body had felt different ever since the end of January . Dr advised me that I would still be monitored for the night . The next day the Dr came and advised me that all my vitals and my heart were doing good and there was no longer need to keep me in here . I asked her if there is risk of getting another heart attack and told me there is always risk but that every thing seemed fine at the moment and that I am also a young person . She told me that I would just need to keep taking my medicines and eating right and follow the discharge papers instruction for home recovery . The days after the discharge from the hospital were a little nerve wrecking but I have felt good . I\\'ve noticed that I have developed brain fog and sometimes get heart palpitations . I do get scared when i feel my heart do weird movements like that . I also get somewhat anxious but I have not had chest pain like the day of the heart attack . I hope there is a solution for all of this and hope to get better . I miss going for walks and hanging out with my friends . I hope I can feel normal once again . I stumbled upon this reddit page while searching up for symptoms and see a lot of people have almost the same stories , the same struggles as I am currently started have them myself .

       " \"Cough and possbile GERD ? Hi it's me again . 24y Male . After a week reading through a lot of your guys ' stories I did find a lot of similarities . For those who don't know I had Covid back in Novemeber ( delta variant ) and had only mild fever for a couple of days . I did develop a cough that went away after 4 weeks . Mid January I started having a lot of symtomps all of a sudden ( hard heart beating , cough / throat clearing , brain fog , bp all over the place , shortness of breath , kidney pain and some strange gurgling noise from my throat after swallowing saliva or drinks ) . So now 5 months after my infection the heart poudning and the shortness of breath are much better aswell as the kidney pain ( when i felt the worst my GFR was at around 76 and now its back to 96 ) . I did all kinds of test and I can say for sure that my heart , kidneys and lungs are in good shape . I also had an ultrasound of my whole abdomen which didn't show anything bad . The cough was pretty bad for a certain amount of time and it's definetly better , but it has developed into this constant throat clearing with muccus sometimes . The bp is still moving up and down , the brain fog is still pretty persistent and the most annyoing thing is the constant throat clearing . It seems like it starts after eating food , drinking coffee but also when i just swallow saliva for some reason . I can't tell if it is silent reflux or not , but my doc said it could be . She said I should try Pantoprazol for 14 days and see if it works . I'm on day 5 of Pantoprazol but I can't really feel a difference actually my stomache feels worse after taking it . I've also developed a little bit of muscle pain that comes and goes , but it doesn't bother me . The strangest thing is when i swallow saliva or a drink I can hear a short gurgling noise after that as if there is a little bit of air coming back up ( no pain just like a burp ) . I'm pretty sure I've never had this before . I don't want to write any triggering words , but my anxiety has gone through the roof in the last few months , because as you know doctor Google always tells you that you don't have much time to live and always leads to the same diseases if you know what I mean :grinning_face_with_sweat: Sorry for the long story .\",\n",

       " ' Then my state degraded to being unable to move , so I stopped . I saw a few neurologists , but they were of little help . I am now diagnosed with \" mental block due to Covid \" . My struggles have nothing to do with my body , as many doctors can attest , and it\\'s all in the brain , whether it be fragments , inflammation , or an evil elf with a taser . I caught Covid in October 2020 , at the age of 18 , when I was barely starting higher education in engineering . I was proficient in my chosen specialty , and did very well in exams . I think that my academic accomplishments important to mention because it gets rather harsh down the line . My acute infection lasted 3 days . I woke up with an awful headache and took some paracetamol to quell its fury . For the next few days , I lay in bed , sweating like I\\'d punctured a waterbed , and zonked out of my mind on insufficient pain relief and headaches like I\\'d never felt before . Googling common symptoms confirmed my suspicions . Sitting up was exhausting . Crawling to the bathroom for water in my studio flat was herculean , and cooking was a lucid nightmare . I tried to keep up with my studies , but that proved to be impossible . I found that the latter was still repulsive , but not overpowering enough to gag , and vinegar had a delicate fragrance . In about two weeks , that had cleared up , and I could smell and taste my terrible cooking again . However , I started to notice that I was having a harder time concentrating , learning , and understanding . The subject matter was a delight to study , but got progressively more time consuming . I knew something terrible was afoot , but I hadn\\'t anticipated quite how terrible it would end up being . I found out pretty quickly that I woke up \" brain-dead \" : where it would take ages to fully wake up and do effective , useful work again . I dubbed this \" cognitive entropy \" : the notion that the mind takes so much effort to spool up and begin functioning properly , but once it\\'s there , you can do anything . Over time , it went from taking a few minutes of maths exercises to warm up the brain , to 4 consecutive hours . Three weeks after acute infection , falling behind on work due to the limitations described above , I decided to just go to bed when I felt like it , because I simply wasn\\'t tired . I had stayed up for 38 consecutive hours , working , without caffeine , until I realised that I needed to see a doctor about this . I have an urge to handwave it away with stress , brain fog , and lack of sleep , but I also have the overwhelming urge to slap my past self . The doctor\\'s appointment was over the phone , and ended with an appointment to see the Cognitive Behavioural Therapist two months later . That appointment went nowhere , despite my requests for a doctor to take my case . By November , merely 4-5 weeks after the acute infection , my brain now a puddle in my skull , where the time it took to wind up my brain was over eight hours , stressed and overwhelmed , I abandoned my studies and devoted myself to resting . I went home for Christmas , and decided to not worry my family with how I felt . The British stiff upper lip at it\\'s finest , there . After the New Year , I confessed my condition to my mum . I knew I couldn\\'t do this alone . We got an appointment with a sleep neurologist in January 2021 . It was a start , but sleep was the least important of my symptoms , though perhaps the root . My sleep was all over the place . I was asked to keep a sleep log . It looked like someone had thrown a dice to determine my sleep pattern . At some points , I had only slept an hour in two days . My brain wasn\\'t so much in pain as it was on fire . I ran a battery of tests and slept overnight in the hospital , covered in electrodes . My sleep was perfect that night : 8 hours , no excessive movement , with two REM cycles , and good O2 levels . The doctor told me to come back in 2 years if my complaints persisted . So yes , I do get why no one believes us , but am really annoyed by it . Over the next few months , the quality of my thoughts seriously degraded . And so on and so forth . Over time , I shrank away from trying so hard to be who I was , and tried to be in the now , to contain the pain as best I could . I avoided pain relief , mostly because paracetamol isn\\'t very kind to the liver . I wasn\\'t in pain when I wasn\\'t thinking , so I went down that dark path of consuming mindless media , which was somehow less entertaining than being depressed . They looked more closely at the MRIs , and concluded that I have unusual inflammation . They sent me to the University hospital of the region in January 2022 , who did a lumbar puncture , and stole half a pint of blood for tests I had already done , alongside a neuropsychological assessment . The former was clear , no infection nor inflammation . The latter found that my memory was impaired , but not too much ; that my concentration was impaired , but was within normal parameters ; my problem solving was nominal ; and I was given the all clear , despite my visible suffering . When I say the quality of my thoughts degraded , I do mean it . My perspectives are less insightful , my comments lack purpose , my reasoning is wonky , and my understanding of others \\' arguments is shallow at best ( compared to how I remember myself from the before times ) . My current hypothesis is that my working memory is so affected , I can\\'t hold multiple ideas in my head at once , and therefore can\\'t combine elements into something bigger . My language is less diverse , because I forget words ',\n",

My LH symptoms stated Summer 2021 with brain fog . I'm young ( 20M ) so it went from being unable to leave my room or hold a conversation to being able to do schoolwork within months . However I then hit a wall where I had the same symptoms for 5 or 6 months ( waning and waxing brain fog , fatigue and the occasional heart palpitation ) while supplementing , eating healthy and working out . In the end of January 2022 , I took a large dose of psilocybin because I thought the neruogentive properties would help the brain to develop new neurons to replace the ones that had been damaged by the fog ( sort of like building a new road instead of clearing the damaged one ) and IT WORKED . Within 3 days I was completely healed . No fog at all . My healed period lasted for about a month until 2 weeks ago . Some unknown force brought this back upon me . I have the brain fog again and what seems to be an electrolyte imbalance where my body isn't retaining the water I give it . I have theories as to why it came back such as being exposed to viral particles and restarting my corrupted immune system , or histamines from pollen activating a response .

I thought I was going to die . I went to the hospital in early April and tested positive a few days later , They had kept me for observation for a few hours , but said there was nothing they could do symptom wise , I could barely walk mile at this point . . Over the course of the next year the fatigue , brain fog , and shortness of breath was the worst - - and persisted as I tried to resume my normal activities slowly . I went back to the hospital , and talked with my doctor and she said that it was probably anxiety at this point . I tried to contact her again to follow up as I was still having extreme shortness of breath and trouble with day to day activities ( grocery runs , finishing homework due to fatigue and unable to breath ) She made me an appointment with her PA and she said the same thing that the Dr . I asked for a note to my professors explaining my previous illness and that I was still having some trouble . Dr S . Obviously . It took a year , but my symptoms slowly went away , shortness of breath last . about a week before I got my first Pfizer vaccine , I felt back to normal . I could run again and I was so relieved . I had my first shot the 12th of May and slowly I started to feel shortness of breath come back . Now I have gotten my second shot and I am terrified . I don't want this permanently and I cannot do it anymore . My doctor said I should get the vaccines as normal and I messaged him - - he is not concerned . I cannot finish my degree if I am not vaccinated , but I can't go back to school like this either ! It is like every breath I take the air is not reaching my lungs . I don't understand . I don't have athsma , . and ran every day before COVID . Will this go away ? I am literally sitting in my bed , and having trouble breathing . Does that sound like anxiety to you ?

       " \"Spironolactone may have changed everything for me I had COVID this time last year ( January 2021 ) and I had what was considered a mild case . I lost my sense of smell for about two weeks , which became distorted a few months later . I didn't have a fever or coughing fits , but I had some significant fatigue , brain fog and body aches . I recovered quickly and thought I was fine , , but then I developed a rapid heart rate and my brain fog and fatigue would set it in if I did anything strenuous with my body , like work out or do heavy lifting at my job . I also broke out in nasty acne that would not go away , along with major shifts in my menstrual cycle after infection . I thought I was fully over COVID , but I actually wasn't . I had tried everything to fix the acne and fatigue . But since my job is a physical job and I was required to wear a mask all day , it made everything worse , especially for my cycle . My PMS , which used to be just mild , became near life-altering . I had a lot of bloating , very painful acne breakouts , much more fatigue and brain fog , worse cramps and my emotions were all over the place . I hated it , so I went to my PCP , who recommended that I see an OB / GYN to rule out PCOS or any other hormonal imbalances . I finally see my OBGYN and she has me get blood tested for my hormone levels and thyroid . It was good timing , as I was in the bout of PMS when I had the tests run , so I figured we could pinpoint what was going on . Turns out my hormone levels were completely normal and my thyroid was normal , as well . I also showed no signs of PCOS . Nothing could explain why my cycle became so wild , so my OBGYN put me on 50mg of spironolactone back in October 2021 , mostly to treat my acne . Which yay ! But it ( MAY HAVE ) also did things I didn't expect : since starting it : my periods have become more regular , my bloating has decreased significantly and it even improved my brain fog and fatigue , especially around my time of the month . And now recently , my rapid heart rate has improved and doesn't happen as often and I have far more energy during the day ! I feel so much more normal AND LIKE MYSELF AGAIN ! ! !

After onboarding and the holidays I was ready to hit the ground running in January , then I got COVID immediately that first week . My symptoms changed every few days , but I\\'ve been stuck with some things that showed up a few days into it that haven\\'t cleared up still . I\\'ve had what I\\'d describe as an afterimage in my vision consistently for 17 days so far . It\\'s coming from my left eye , almost in the center of my vision , can see it with my eyes closed , and it never changes shape . Thought it was weird so I sat down . Then about a minute later I get a wave of pressure in my head that settles on the left side by my ear . Had left ear pressure all day , when I swallowed I could feel it on the left side , and my neck ached on the left side . That went away after I woke up the next day . Checked my blood pressure , it\\'s slightly elevated , but not dropping when I stand . Getting lightheaded and dizzy too .

I\\'m finally able to stay awake through the day ( although my energy levels do go down on some days , and resting for about 20 minutes brings me back to life ) . I felt cursed at month one .

I couldn\\'t walk into the other room at month 2 without crawling back into bed to sleep for another 4 hours .

My symptoms were so bad ( dizziness , brain fog , poor memory , poor concentration ) , that I was convinced I had a stroke at some point when I had passed out that evening . Fast forward through Aug , Sep , Oct , Nov and I dealt with terribly memory recall ( forgetting things that had happened just days / hours ago , really poor concentration , tip of the tongue things but never able to remember ) and awful brain fog , to the point where I went to the local emergency room to seek out a scan for permanent damage . Now , what I did to nearly recover . First , I only attempted to exercise once , and learned that it caused re-emergence of MAJOR symptoms , mostly brain fog . However , the things that helped me the most ( in order of helpfulness ): * Sleep : I began using roughly 500mg L-Theanine powder in water right as I layed down to sleep , this allowed me to begin sleeping thru the night instead of waking up after 3-4 hours of sleep . If I do not get at least 8-9 hours of sleep , my brain fog is noticeable all day upon waking . This continues today . * Fish Oil ( high quality ) : When I started taking a high quality fish oil is when symptoms began to truly improve , no doubt about it . Without posting a link , I used a brand called Nutrigold Triple Strength 2,100 mg per serving which I found to be the best cost to quality ration available . These 3 things are what I believe led to my recovery ( 75-90 % back to normal ) and I couldn\\'t put a price on any of them . Waking up in the morning after 9 hours of sleep and relatively clean eating the day before feels almost exactly the same as before I went thru the debilitating , confusing , foggy experience of long COVID . There are some other things that may have helped me recover too ( in no particular order ): cut out binge drinking alcohol , but still slipped and had a few drinks here and there , ZERO caffeine for the last 2 months ( this cannot be understated ) , zinc , vitamin C , Alpha Brain memory and focus ( for when you absolutely need to power thru despite your long COVID symptoms , this was really helpful ) , juicing apples + kale + oranges + grapefruit + cucumber + carrots + ginger in a masticating juicer . This post is getting longer than intended so will wrap it up here , will respond to comments if there are any ',\n",

       " \"Occipital neuralgia from Covid ? Hey group ! Super sorry for the long explanation but I'm trying to figure this out , and would like some insight . There may be doctors on here , there may not be , and that's fine , just please read . I'm desperate . I was formally diagnosed with Occipital neuralgia a couple weeks ago . Never had any issues with migraines leading up to recovering from Covid , but after recovering I had migraines at least 5 times a month . The migraines significantly got worse and more persistent over the course of the summer and around early July I started seeing a chiropractor and massage therapist . My PCP started me on topiramate and amitriptyline which made the headaches go away for a short Period of time , and that helped me come to the conclusion most of the pain was coming from my neck . I was still going to chiropractor and massage therapy appointments with no improvement , and I was still working . The migraines and neck pain came back full force and worse to the point I had to take a leave of absence from work . As soon as I left work , I was laid up on my floor for 2 1/2 weeks in SEVERE pain . Constant migraine , with neck pain that radiated to my right shoulder blade , and the pain was deep . My pcp ordered an MRI of my brain and cervical spine once I had recovered from the severe pain , which showed absolutely nothing except a straightening of my cervical spine . My pcp referred me to a physical therapist which didn't help much . Then to a neurologist who won't take me seriously , and is a pill pusher . And then finally to a pain specialist . The reason I want some insight is because I'd never had an issue with headaches or migraines before Covid . Like at all ! Could this be apart of Covid ? Or is this from an injury ? Let me preface this by saying I work in a fast paced environment where I do a lot of bending , twisting , pulling , pushing etc . And for those of you who don't know what occipital neuralgia is , it's an inflammation of the nerves that run from your spine , into your scalp in the back of your head . It can be caused by viruses ( Covid ? ) , trauma , entrapment from surrounding muscles , an inflammation of arteries or veins , etc . It causes a slew of symptoms that range from mild to severe \",\n",

My way of life has been extremely limited and I'm barely hanging on in the last year of my masters program . I've always been very careful about who I'm around , making sure I'm masked and I'm even triple vaxxed , but I also teach at a university and there's not many options when it comes to teaching online for me so I'm around students every week . Last night I felt a slight tickle in my throat which I chalked up to allergies or something else . I had also been feeling slightly more tired than usual ( I've learned not to get too down when I have bad fatigue days ) . When I woke up this morning , my sore throat was significantly worse and I had a headache along with it . They called me about 30 minutes after to tell me I'm positive . A few days prior to this , I went to the doctor to update her on my previous long COVID symptoms . She put me on prednisone and also noted that at the time of the blood tests , my white blood cell count was slightly low . My running theory here is that my WBC was low bc my body was actively fighting off COVID and the prednisone weakened my immune system to the point where it could replicate . I'm worried that continuing to take the prednisone could make recovery worse or lead to more severe symptoms ( I have asthma ) . I'm also worried that this second round of COVID will put me back at the starting line or even worse , push me even further back than when I started .

Like , the only thing that was bothering me were my sinuses feeling dry and my eyes kinda hurt . I was fine after a couple of weeks . Well , one week after recovering , on February 1st , bada bing bada boom health anxiety has entered the room . This is because I suddenly started experiencing similar symptoms to what I had during mono , which was kinda just mild neurological things , but like , significantly worse ? ? ? I am a very anxious person so I did the worst thing I could possibly do which is google and research . bad move ! I spent February and March spiraling down into this hellish hole of the worst depression and anxiety I have every experienced in my LIFE thanks to me googling my symptoms . i was convinced i was stuck with reactivated mono i\\'d be plagued with for eternity . i had no idea how to interpret any of these random pains all over my body . I barely slept because I was crying myself to sleep every night because i just KNEW i was gonna die . BAD MOVE ! ! ! i felt like i was living a nightmare and i wanted to wake up and be done with it all . There\\'s some dramatic post on here from my other account I lost access to . I was literally losing my mind ranting over how i just KNEEEWWWW i was gonna die young . So , over the course of those few months I went to the ER two times , had SO much bloodwork done , ultrasounds etc . but somehow knowing that did not help . I hated that everything was \" fine \" , if it was fine then why was i in pain all the time ? ! It finally clicked that this anxiety and paranoia was ruining my life and i knew i had to pick myself back up . my doctor prescribed my antidepressants late March and ever since it has totally changed the game for me . I have not had a single mental breakdown over this situation or even been bothered much by my health anxiety at all ever since , and i am so SO grateful that it\\'s working out for me . i also stopped googling symptoms and going on reddit completely which helped so much . * * \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ \\\\ _ * * With my improving mental health , I feel much more like myself . Now that I can think about my symptoms with a clearer mind , I understand that they are mostly neurological . I originally thought some abdominal pain i had been experiencing was due to some issues with the actual organs in there , and neck pain i had was from my actual throat having some issues .. nerve pain ? which is driving me insane cuz idk why it\\'s happening or when it will stop . : 0 Basically . I will get areas on my body that feel like they have an awful bruise there but no mark . the area will be very sensitive to the touch and hurts to press , just like a bruise . this literally can happen on any area of my body , and these spots last anywhere from a few hours to days . it\\'s usually just a few spots at a time though , and sometimes im lucky enough to be pain free . i dont think anything triggers these pains and they seem to just happen at random . they are not debilitating but can get very uncomfortable . ESPECIALLY when it\\'s my head . it\\'s not a regular headache but a miserable throbbing stabby pain inside my scalp like the nerves there are just looosing it . when it affects my head i\\'ll also get some annoying eye pain and it will hurt to look around . i also feel like my ribs and chest have been very sensitive to the touch every since all this started ? sometimes this bruised sensation even affects my TEETH like wtf ? Aside from these weird invisible bruises , i\\'ve also been .. :/ Also , every single time i wake up , one or both of my legs will be freezing to the touch ? ? i was also waking up with them numb for quite a while but that didn\\'t happen while i was awake . this also happened to my arms a few times as well which was strange . I was experiencing itchiness and tingling for a while but that stopped and im kind of just stuck with the reoccurring bruising feeling now ? ? My other symptom is .. some of them are in a tiny little cluster . they appeared right after i got covid and i swear i think they are not disappearing but still multiplying ! ! ! the first one i noticed 3 months ago in february is STILL THERE ! and more still seem to be appearing . they are super tiny but they are rather unnerving lol i feel like one of these days im just gonna be a big red dot . also another weird thing that started after all of this is when i shower or take a bath , i get these painless non-itchy raised red blotches on my lower legs . one last symptom that is weird as hell and i have never heard anyone else mention ! this actually started for the first time when i got mono and it didn\\'t come back until after covid . occasionally i get these painful stinging bumps in my armpit underneath the skin . ( it is not an ingrown hair ) these have occured in multiple areas of my armpit so it\\'s not just the same exact place it\\'s happening in . and i thought may be swollen lymph nodes ? ? but it\\'s so strange . on occasion these bumps appear on their own but it is mostly if i just gently prod the area it might trigger one of these bumps to appear out of seemingly nowhere and swell and it will sting SO BAD like a bee stung me or something ! ! the area and maybe even my whole arm will be sore for up to 2 days after this . it\\'s so weird . oh , and also . brain fog . i literally feel like my IQ is in the negatives since all of this happened . I am getting an ultrasound of that area and also an MRI for all this weird nerve stuff that\\'s going on ',\n",

Mods sorry if I'm breaking any rules with this and I'm happy to confirm my main identity by pm if needed . I also did strength training for fitness . I do have a couple of auto immune issues that I've had since being a teenager . First symptoms I noticed was confusion and brain fog along with nerve issues / numbness in my head and legs . Within a short time I also started experiencing random breathing issues , insomnia , tinnitus , rapid heartbeat , extremely severe headaches , random sore throats , costochondritis , depression ( first time ever ) , bad dizziness / vertigo , memory loss , severe fatigue , random diarrhoea and other digestion issues , random but very sharp pains in lungs , chest , left arm , left armpit , strange vibrating sensation , anxiety ( again completely new for me and over the stupidest things ) and vision issues . Like many on here visited doctors who ran checks , diagnosed the costochondritis but couldn't find a cause for the symptoms listed above . A Neurologist put me on Nortiptyline for the nerve issues , depression , insomnia and tinnitus but that was as far as I got with the professionals . Again like many the next 6 months were basically a write off . Some of the symptoms were that bad that without being dramatic some nights I went to bed wondering if I'd wake up ( by then I was surprisingly at ease with it if I didn't ) . Any exertion whatsoever resulted in the worst headaches ive ever experienced and basically being in bed for days at a time . Ive collapsed more than once . Every day was a bad day and I have no idea how I managed to hold onto my job as I made some serious and pretty far reaching mistakes ( somewhat senior position ) and missed more time than I have in my entire working life put together up until this point . Thankfully although the owner is somewhat skeptical of the virus he's a decent person and understood I was having health issues that were having an impact on my ability to function . Finally , over the last 4-6 weeks I have finally started to feel a little like my former self before all this started . I'm still having bad days , but im also starting to have more okay ones . I can even take my dog for a steady 1 mile walk without relapsing for days . If I do have a flare up ( is that the right term ? ) then they only last a day or two now and I can still function in a sense . Unfortunately I think the tinnitus is here to stay - its not as bad as it was at the start but it is always there and my left leg is completely numb around the knee down towards my ankle . I also get periods of random heart racing for no reason whatsoever , something I've had since this all started . I also get a regular sore throat and random shortness of breath still . The main reason for this post ? To say thank you . A word of warning though . Even though I'm starting to have better days I'm still a long way from being back to normal . And today I briefly overdid it at work . Felt okay straight after but within 30 minutes I was very dizzy and then developed an extremely strong headache that won't quit . Typing this I've got that horrible whole vibrating thing going on and my heartbeat is very rapid , ten hours after the event . So please don't push or rush anything as it's not worth it \",\n",

The backstory : She tested positive for COVID back in October , suffered through the initial infection for about 3 weeks with many of the symptoms ( fatigue , burning sensation in the nostrils , loss of taste and smell , brain fog , body aches ) . From then , she started recovering and by about December , was mostly back to normal with the exception of occasional brain fog . That changed about a month ago . She developed this persistent , daily headache that also came with intense pressure and never went away , despite taking OTC medication . It got to the point that I had to take her to the ER almost 2 weeks ago , and all they could do was give her medication for the pain . While it seems that there have been minor improvements ( the pressure went from being constant to intermittent ) , she's still heavily suffering and had a flair-up so bad last night that the only thing she could do was take a Xanax and sleep . Today , she's still dealing with pressure and we don't really know what to do . Nothing gives her relief another than ice packs , which just take the edge off . We have a follow-up appointment with the PCP scheduled for next week , but we're going to try and get it moved up to this week so we can get more information and hopefully make some more progress .

I cut those out , along with caffeine , for about 3-4 weeks and by mid-April I was back to basically living my normal life . Exercising again , drinking again - both coffee and alcohol . In fact , given the reopening this summer , I was probably drink more and sleeping less than I typically do . Then in mid-July , following a pretty extreme stretch ( stayed up until 8am one night , then was out drinking almost every night for about two weeks ) , I relapsed and began experiencing brain fog and headaches again .

I was able to deal w the issues through rest , low activity ( but some was better than none ) , Advil and these turmeric pills I found that worked really well . Eventually my primary care recommended getting vaccinated as it seemed to be curing long haul symptoms . I got vaccinated in very early May and started improving immediately . About two weeks later I was mostly long haul symptom free and feeling great . By four weeks out from my first shot I felt as good as cured . Fast forward to last week , about 2 months after my first vaccine shot . I wake up in the middle of the night with the jackhammer heartbeat that was identical to what I had when long haul problems first started . I spent a couple days with the strong heartbeat coming and going randomly throughout the day . Then the past three days it's just been consistent 24 hrs / day with the jackhammer heartbeat and I've noticed my hands have been a little shaky when the heartbeat is at its worst which is new for me . There are really no other symptoms though . The old things I used to do to deal with it aren't working great and I'm not sure what to do or where to go .

The day before I had been attempting to sweep the house , I could barely manage it , my HR hit 174 and I almost passed out . I've basically been couch bound ever since . My tachycardia is worse then it's ever been . I get up from bed and it kicks right in , it's hitting at least in 130 ' s now standing up or doing nothing . My showers are getting up to that or higher . My brain goes fuzzy , my vision goes dim and blurry . I have chest discomfort and a cough again , it kicks up with excitement or too much movement . I have high blood pressure . All this started after I thought I recovered and resumed pretty heavy exercise . I was tolerating it , i thought life could be normal again , then around July 31st my chest discomfort started , SOB , and coughing , and now here I am .

All of my bloodwork is coming back normal as well . I'm excited to have this appt tomorrow but I wanted to see if anyone had any tips or suggestions on what to ask for .

       " \"Results said one thing , but symptoms said otherwise . Hi everyone , I am still on the fence on whether or not what I experienced from March to June was Covid , mostly because my results and doctors said it was just stress and anxiety , but my symptoms might say otherwise . My symptoms started back in mid-March with diarrhea , loss of appetite , fatigue , shortness of breath , chest pain , some slight congestion in my right nostril that comes and goes , a mild sore throat and a low grade fever . One morning mid-March I experienced chills and I never developed a cough . There were a few nights I couldn't fall asleep because my sob was so bad , and would sweat through whole shirts sleeping at night . I got tested on March 20th , just a few days before my symptoms started to appear , and 6 days later my results came back negative . I started to feel better , still had some sob and a mild sore throat but I did feel as though it might have just been anxiety or some other infection . Only a couple weeks went by , and I started to experience different symptoms . This time it was soreness in the back of my knees every night before bed , some random tingling sensations on my tongue , and really uncomfortable pains in my heart as though I was about to have a heart attack . This heart pain was accompanied with tingling in my left arm . Had an EKG , stress test and wore a heart monitor for a week . All results came back normal ( had a covid swab test in order to get the stress test and that also came back negative ) . Even had an antibody test a few weeks after that which also came back negative . Based on all of the stories I read on this subreddit , it is really easy to identify with a lot of the symptoms that some of you share . Does anyone have any similar experiences like this ? I still have congestion in my right nostril that comes and goes but otherwise I am feeling much better . If it was anxiety all along , why are the physical symptoms of anxiety not manifesting like they were then , especially if I am feeling just as anxious ?\",\n",

One of the things I've been most frustrated about is the conflicting information about whether or not covid long haulers who experience relapses are once again contagious . I know I could go get tested , but since it's been less than 2 months there's a good chance I'll still be positive . I just have so much anxiety surrounding every last tiny little remaining / returning symptom because I can't be 100 % sure that I wasn't exposed to something again , since I live with someone else who is experiencing post-covid life very differently .

I need to drink at least 3-4 cups of coffee ( or some other type of stimulant / caffeine ) to just function normally , or at least how I used to . I know it's Covid related , because I've simply never experienced exhaustion like this in my life except for extreme exercise or 12 hour work shifts , etc .

In between the first and second shot , I started experiencing incredible light sensitivity , inability to zoom or look at screens , an ocular migraine and extreme exhaustion after looking at screens .

At that point I started going to doctors , had many PCR tests , ended up in the ER , started crashing daily and have slowly been on the mend . But incredible fatigue .
